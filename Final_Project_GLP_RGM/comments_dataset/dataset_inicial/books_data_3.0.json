Text \"resist\" to \"504-09\" and it'll ask you some questions, then you're onto writing. From another thread a few weeks ago, someone posted this message, and it think it's a great one to send. \n\n\"Net Neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation, free speech and democracy on the Internet.\n\nControl over the Internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day. The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology, science, small business, and culture. \n\nPlease stand with the public by protecting Net Neutrality once and for all.\"\n\nI'd love to credit the user, but have lost the comment, but please, go send some faxes, show your politicians you want net neutrality to stay.\n\n* Share away! Seriously only takes a few minutes of your time.. You can also find this Bot on Facebook Messenger \"ResistBot\"",

          "text": "I'm normally opposed to getting involved in these types of protests but in the spirit of solidarity on this unique issue here is the letter I wrote on the matter to government individuals relative to me (sparing names because I'm loathe to give breadcrumbs to my identity on the internet) :\n\nAs we are on the cusp of a repeal of net neutrality I believe strongly that this is a turning point for Republican politics in the long term.  My steadfast loyalty to the Republic party has been resolute due to my steadfast believe in a party platform of personal ethics, responsibility and freedom.  However a steadfast faith in free market economics (in general) should not be confused with a belief in market anarchy.\n\nThe nature of internet neutrality is not hostile to the free market unless we are absolutely devoid of nuance in our appreciation of the market.  Even a fan favorite Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, understood that there are certain protections for the spirit of free enterprise that must guarantee a de facto fair trading place if we can expect the merits of a free market to rule.\n\nConsumers do not have the power to choose a different supply if the majority of a primary resource is controlled by a de facto aristocracy like a fief who does not rely on the traditional rules we come to expect that allows clear winners and losers to emerge.  In smalltown Louisiana a simple matter of anti-business, anti-competitor practices carried out by super chains create an economic dependency where choice is robbed of the consumer, because a manipulation of resources guarantees that the success or failure of a local market is irrelevant, because national and international resources will be pumped into defeating competition until the consumer is left with only a single choice.\n\nThis Wal-Mart Effect is a dangerous possibility with the repeal of internet neutrality.  The internet in its earliest days was a luxury of those that could afford personal PCs, leisure time, and the chance to browse an emerging technology.  So much of our cultural, economic, and social strata is now definitively affected by our access to the internet.  Most of our president's decrees, in fact, are more accessible through the internet than traditional press means.\n\nAnd with this murky territory that the internet exists in, somewhere between a service and a utility, the Republican Party, as the majority holders in Congress and the \"face\" of current domestic policy, are in effect telling the people of the United States that this borderline utility, even our very access to the President's preferred method of communication, should be arbitrated by private holding gatekeepers.  This amounts to, quite literally, the digital age's equivalence of emerging railroad barons, who guarantee access for the few that enrich the already industrious elite, on the back of infrastructure that is consistently already facilitated by public means.\n\nThe repeal of internet neutrality is a matter that will, indisputably, occur in the future.  Aristocratic style monopolies have never existed in perpetuity and the dangerous tycoon fostering that the FCC's proposed revocation will insure guarantees that in time this FCC repeal *will* be overturned.\n\nHowever in that time the Republican Party will have suffered the irreparable damage of being the facilitators of this madness.  The historic damage will be done and after 8 years of the face of Democrats the Republicans, in their first year of power, will have tarnished their reputation so thoroughly that in future films casting directors will ask for Bella Lugosi look alikes to play the Republican leaders in biopics about this event.\n\nIf the Republican Party hopes to retain seats and my loyalty they must demonstrate that they believe in the principles of a fair market, not the creation of a nobility class that controls one of the most important means of communication and business in our time so that anti-capitalist exploits will keep us in a digital dark age.\n\nI implore you to use anything within your power to block this attempt to repeal net neutrality in the spirit of Republican values.",

I am not sure if there has ever been an initiative so unpopular with the public, many times rebuked, yet that is nonetheless pushed forward, again and again, by giant corporate buaurocracies and corrupt officials.\n\n\nMany of the evils that killing off net neutrality would bring about have already been mentioned in many threads. The biggest one seems to be only glossed about though. In my view, the whole fight is primarily about the control of information flow. This is way bigger and way more important than, for example, charging fees for access, although that too is a part of the same game.\n\n\nControl of information can take very insidious forms. The goal is to dismantle the internet as a free for all competition of ideas where corporate powers (ISPs and their affiliates) do not have an automatic, insurmountable advantage. The game is not rigged enough in their favour, which is why we are seeing repeated attempts to move the goal posts. \n\n\nImagine a future internet where you are not able to create an accessible website or blog unless you sign an agreement that all content you put online will be reviewed by your ISP, and obviously confined to a list of pre-approved topics. If you want to stay afloat, you will be well advised to show proper ideological fervor by peppering your site with grassroots slogans such as: \"Comcast is great!\", \"Corporations are cuddly people\", or \"In ISP, we trust.\". All with a smile on your face, lest you be thought as an enemy of the system.",

Tyrion kills his father avenging Tysha and Dany decides to learn to rule rather than just conquer and pillage. Those three books are tight, cohesive and we'll edited. The next two books while having good content are anything but cohesive. It's not just the timeline jumps, it's that POVs and storylines that seemingly have no purpose, some chapters are ridiculously long, etc. Whatever magic GRRM had in the 90s he has yet to be able to recapture. \n\nSide note though, the Dunk and Egg novellas are great.",

Too many broken promises. You try, but things feel forced. You can already see how it's going to end and it's not good, but you have this irrational hope that things could be the way they used to be.\n\nAnd the show just made it worse because it stole away the tension of \"what will happen?\" And delay and the awful drawn out boredom of books 4 and 5 killed our memory of how good it felt to read those first three books because that was like 20 years ago. \n\nNot like this is the first time an epic fantasy has lost its way and probably never will be finished. If anything, that feels like the expected course for the genre now, and it makes it awfully hard for me as a reader to commit to reading any series that isn't finished",

Other books full of bad science certainly exist, and many of them are for sale on Amazon. That fact does not constitute an endorsement by the company of their contents.

I follow him on Twitter, where school teachers have been asking him for weeks if he would be okay with this and his answer has been an emphatic yes every time. So many people asked him that he put out a blanket message that just said \"yes everyone has permission to read my stories over video.\" Neil Gaiman genuinely values reading and the sharing of stories over literally anything else, especially things like copyrights. Neil Gaiman is a champion of storytelling so it is absolutely fitting that his stories would end up 'on' Reading Rainbow.",

Thankfully it's no longer in practice, and would never be tolerated again, but I cannot get my head around how fine people used to be with it.

A place where people do their time but at the same time regain their humanity so that when they get out, they can reenter society and function in it and live a normal life.\n\nThere are probably institutions out there in the US that do this, but they are few and far between.\n\nAlso... I understand that there are inmates who have done terrible, terrible things.  They themselves have the right to do their time and try and regain their humanity.

I believe prisoners can also purchase their own books from specific shops online. If we take books at the desk, it takes about 2 weeks to get to them. What I do is basically flick through the books to check nothing is in there (no notes etc.), record the details in a book, put it in a see through bag, attach a yellow label etc etc. I also make the visitor fill out a handing in books form. It is basically the first step. However, the  books get checked again inside the prison before they reach the prisoner. There is enough security.  I don't think this is even about security though and it makes no sense. How is making it harder to read for prisoners going to result in better outcomes and rehabilitation? It is simply not. The way I see it, they just want to make them suffer and that is all. The benefits of reading for everyone -incarcerated or not - are countless. However, for someone who has lost their liberty, it is even more important to have access to books. \n\nAlso see the following about previous book ban in the UK:\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31083737",

They don't know wtf *IT* really is and they really don't want to remember or talk about **it**. The creature is the personification of *it*; the deadlights are the spacial representation of *it*.\n\n\nAt the end, in the '58 sewers, they hadn't truly beaten IT but Beverly knew they had to somehow beat **it** to continue. They couldn't just sit around and talk about sex, they knew nothing about sex, the entire concept was still *it*. The creature's power was over those who accepted \"*it*\" as a societal norm. They beat IT and then they had to beat *it*. And for people who say Bev got used, fuck you, Bev beat the shit out of **it** (practically by herself) twice in one night.\n\n\nAs adults they first had to beat *it* in their homes and minds before they could leave to beat IT. Stan just couldn't get it up the second time around.",

Too much considering their age and how invested in the characters you are after 1000+ pages.\n\nKing has said its bridging the gap between childhood and adulthood (ooook) but it seemed unnecessary and made no logical sense as a way to suddenly know how to navigate a labyrinth in complete darkness. \n\nThe whole end is kinda bizarre. Bills wife, who did not grow up in Derry, is in a comatose state. Bill dresses her and himself up in children's clothes and puts her on his old bicycle knowing this would somehow make her snap out of it despite her having no connection to his childhood. Oh and I think King mentioned Bill getting a \"playful erection\" when she wakes up on the bike. Just the visual image of two adults wearing kids clothes hurtling through town on a bike while the guy has a raging hard on still is comical to me. ",

          "text": "Here's the full quote. \n\n>*I wasn‚Äôt really thinking of the sexual aspect of it. The book dealt with childhood and adulthood ‚Äì1958 and Grown Ups. The grown ups don‚Äôt remember their childhood. None of us remember what we did as children‚Äìwe think we do, but we don‚Äôt remember it as it really happened. Intuitively, the Losers knew they had to be together again. The sexual act connected childhood and adulthood. It‚Äôs another version of the glass tunnel that connects the children‚Äôs library and the adult library. Times have changed since I wrote that scene and there is now more sensitivity to those issues.* \n\nMy take on it. \n\n>I wasn‚Äôt really thinking of the sexual aspect of it.\n\nI don't even know what to say here. I totally get the artistic reasoning for doing things (not this though) and the like but I don't see how you could write a gang bang of kids and just think nothing of the sex. \n\n>The sexual act connected childhood and adulthood.\n\nThey could have done something else to signify that. Ben could have brought a cigar or a nip of whisky and they all had a go at that. Their dialogue afterwards and perspectives written afterwards could have shown the connection. \n\n>. Times have changed since I wrote that scene and there is now more sensitivity to those issues.\n\nUh King as much as I love you. 99% of the population never has been for child gang bangs. \n\nIt's a horror book about child murder, so the murder is expected, kid gang bangs not so much. The part that makes the book scary isn't the clown per se it's the fact that kids are being killed; no one wants to float. So his comment about \"only paying attention to the gang bang\" is odd. It's like dude if someone served you a dinner of steak, potato and then put a scoop of shit on your steak. You're not going to talk about how your upset that the shit was on the steak. You're going to make mention of the fact that you were served shit to begin with. \n\n",

As the boys start to panic, Beverly comes up with the idea of having sex with the others in order to calm them down, as a result the other Losers take turns having sex with her. Because King didn't wish this to be viewed as a lewd scene, the narrative explicitly states that the act of intimacy with each of the boys' helps to further strengthen their friendship; and Beverly only experiences orgasm while having intercourse with Bill Denbrough and Ben Hanscom.\n\nId say Stephen King truly captured the mind of 14-year-olds prioritizing sex over anything else - in this case being lost in the domain of a supernatural being hell-bent on torturing and eating them. However, these kids are supposedly 11 years old. This is bringing me back to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World more than anything.",

Their status as misfits is one shared. In It's world, these symbolic connections are given power by the belief of the kids, much like It's strength is empowered by their belief beget by fear. Something like sex for the first time, already occupying a weird and almost sacred space in any kid's psyche, has enough symbolic power tying them all together that it would empower them in such an other-worldly encounter. It's weird and certainly not recommended for a real situation but these factors make it make sense when they sought to protect themselves before their showdown with It. \n\nIt's been a long time since I read the book but that's how I remember feeling about it at the time.

We have all at one time or another been embarrassed by our inexperience or ashamed by our self-perceptions (penis size, breast size, sexual performance). We have all been taught conflicting ideas about sexuality through the various media/religion/societal pressures around us. We have all found ourselves being aroused by, or detecting a sexual experience we either witness from afar or feel first-hand. \n\nMeanwhile, barely any of us have experienced murder. Only a few of us commit or witness a murder so that our connection to the killing of another human being is MUCH more abstract when you compare it to the feelings we associate with all things sexual. \n\nThere's a reason why a scene of a man taking a swig of alcohol means more to a recovering alcoholic, or the scene of a rape scene means more to someone who has experienced such abuse. You will find the most emotional reaction from a person when they have a personal stake in the subject being portrayed. It is easy to become desensitized by violence because most of us do not experience it in the ways that we see on television. However, you can bet that there are plenty of people that are ashamed enough of their arousal from a gangbang that they will morph it into a knee-jerk reaction of fear and disgust.\n\nI'm sure that there are plenty of other factors that go into this, in my opinion, the most important one is that sexuality is much more real to the average person than murder.",

          "text": "Due to covid, all exams for 16 and 18 year olds were cancelled in the UK. These are the big ones, GCSEs and A levels respectively. the A levels particularly determine whether you get into the first or second college or university of your choice. \n\nDue to the cancellation of exams, teachers were asked to provide an expected grade for each person based on their work over the previous 2 years and their mock exam results. \n\nInstead of awarding these grades, the government then directed the exam boards to run these predicted grades through an algorithm that took into account the previous results from that particular school. \n\nThe result? The majority of students from schools in poorer areas received results (in some cases 3 grades) lower than predicted, while richer areas had their results raised. \n\nWhile it wasn't meant to do this in concept, it was meant to ensure teachers were not unfairly generous, unfortunately it generally happens that schools in poor areas do worse. (Socioeconomic deprivation etc). Therefore, those schools were hit very harshly by the algorithm.\n\nThe students worse hit were the exceptional outliers in these poor schools. Brilliant students who had worked their way through their tough circumstances only to have their As turned to Cs and Ds. \n\nThink back to those times, you work your butt off for 12 years only to have it ripped away by an algorithm because you live somewhere poor. It's a terrible scandal that I don't think many outside really understand.",

It‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù said Jessica Johnson, a student at Ashton Sixth Form College in Greater Manchester. ‚ÄúI based it on the educational inequality I already saw. I just exaggerated that inequality and added the algorithm.

Now that results will be based on teacher assessments instead, she is hopeful that her place will be restored.\n\n>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been so stressed and anxious these past few days, waiting to hear back from universities,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe got told you can go wherever you want in life if you work hard enough, but we‚Äôve seen this year that no matter how hard you worked, you got given a grade based on where you live.‚Äù\n\n>Prof Jean Seaton, director of the Orwell prize, said: ‚ÄúJessica saw into the heart of what the system represents and her story demonstrates the human ability which exams only exist to uncover.‚Äù\n\n>Johnson said the inspiration behind her writing was to mix educational inequality with the dystopian genre. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not exactly a fairy tale I wanted to come true!‚Äù",

On top of that there were a few cases where students were discouraged from contesting their results, such as an education ombudsman telling students that if they do it and get bumped up a grade, they're causing someone else to drop a grade.\n\nIn all it was a major fuckup, the government tried shifting the blame onto students/schools, and after a *lot* of people got pissed off the government backtracked.",

When we asked them how they separated they said by grade level. I told them I had a 98 in math. Did everyone in A and B have 99s and 100s? Teacher looked at me straight in the face and said yes.  \n\nFast forward a year to 8th grade, A and B group took pre algebra while the rest of us took more remedial math type of course. We all had mixed group home room, so during home room, two of the A group asked me for help with pre algebra. I never saw it but I'd read the couple pages then read the examples they wrote down then would show them. At the end of the year, the math teacher had to sign off on what math we went into. If you done pre algebra she'd sign you up for algebra and you'd be able to complete college course math in high school. If not, you were put into another remedial math, then 10th grade pre algebra (you read that right), then 11th algebra 1, 12th algebra 2.  \n\nI went up to the teacher at the end to get my paper signed for what class she was going to put me in. She looked at me and looked kinda troubled then even though I saw her use the top stamp on everyone in my group C (for remedial math in high school) she looked at me and asked, \"I feel like I've seen your handwriting alot this semester. Do you know what I mean?\" I'd do an example or two while teaching two A group students and they never erased. I hesitated and said, \"yeah\" and she frowned and looked down and stamped me in for algebra 1 saying \"I believe you can do it.\" which put me on a college pathway I may not have otherwise pursued.  \n\nSorting by class just showed me that those who have, will keep, and those who don't, will struggle. It's just another way to halt upward mobility in this country.",

The local library and goodwill sponsor this so I always have a mountain of books to give out.

I feel like a lollipop or toy worth 2 dollars would be way better if you want kids to actually read and keep liking it. \n\nEDIT:  as /u/TheQueg and /u/punfull point out, the end of the article strongly implies that the barber gives the 2 dollars directly to the kid, instead of giving a 2 dollar discount. While there'll still be parents who take back the 2 dollars from their kids, I guess they'd be a minority. If it's actually like that, I definitely *do* like it, because the kid gets an actual tangible reward themselves, and gets a positive reward for reading, while the parents aren't that strongly incentivized to force their kids to read. After all, it's the kids' choice of whether they want the two bucks or not.  ",

If anything I liked it because it was bittersweet, it made the witches scarier.  It was the first book I remember reading that had such an ending and I was happy for the little boy that he would pass with his beloved grandmother. I think children are smarter than adults give them credit for; I knew at that age that some children died young. \n\nIf you‚Äôre a child old enough to read the witches, you likely know death is a major part of the world. The witches is, frankly, a dark book. Remember at the beginning when the grandmother is telling the boy about other children who disappeared because of witches? I remember LOVING that part because oh my god how fascinating. How scary. It felt like a ‚Äúserious‚Äù story and I loved it.\n\nOverall yes I remember loving this entire book as a child and the movie ending cheapens it. Let these witches stay terrifying. Let kids get excited and scared. It only enriches the stories they read.",

But at his funeral I met his parents and learned that he had a congenital heart condition and hadn't even been expected to make it to 20. By living to 28 he had, in fact, surpassed everyone's expectations. I also learned that he had intentionally refrained from telling anyone other than his closest friends that he was going to die relatively soon because he didn't want anyone to treat him differently because of it.\n\nReflecting on our relationship after that I realized that a lot of what had a attracted me to him in the first place was the fact that he was really only concerned with doing good where he could and having fun where he could and making the most of whatever time he had. He lived the amount of life he had to its absolute fullest and touched the lives of everyone he encountered.\n\nAll this is to say, as depressing as it is to think about, I think you're right that children who probably won't have a full lifespan do absolutely deserve to know that at some point so they can live their best lives, and to be told that just because a life is shorter doesn't make it any less important.",

Yeah, you might find it a bit sad.  But to me, it also shows that children often have a lack of empathy- remember, it's children who are the most notorious for the age-old idea of burning insects like ants.  It's also why so many children get called a variety of names by adults- kids might do dumb things (a whole subreddit is dedicated to this), but they can also be very,very cruel as well.\n\nRoald Dahl is infamous for the darkness within his childrens' stories... but maybe he also understood that children also have the ability to go, \"Oof, that wasn't nice.

I think that is why his books are so beloved by kids and adults. He doesn't sugarcoat things, nor does he make it all darkness. His stories have bullies and conformists and clever kids and regular kids and wonderful adults and hateful adults.  There are giants, magical grains of rice, witches, talking mice, enchanted fruit, huge insects, rivers of chocolate, experimental candy, and so many other unexpected things. Like some musicians have a sound, he has a very unique style. There's nobody like him. \n\nHis books for adults are also good. Darker, short, but in a way that fits.

          "text": "Probably not. People are a lot less content starved now than in 1998. I had a computer connected to the internet back then, but it took 8 minutes to download a .JPG of a pikachu so for the purposes of our discussion the modern internet didn't exist.\n\nBack around the turn of the millenium, there were about 25,000 \"fiction\" books a year published in the english language. 25k sounds like a lot at a glance, but assuming an author publishes every other year that's supporting at most 50k writers from a then US/UK population of 340 million.\n\nThese books almost exclusively went through the traditional publishing pipeline. Authors would pitch their manuscript to the publisher like a screenwriter does to Hollywood execs, and the decision process was very similar, throwing around business terms like \"marketability\", \"formula\", \"target demographics\" and \"formulas\".\n\nToday, there are about 200,000 fictions \"published\" per year in english. It's fashionable on Reddit to shit on Amazon because their founder is a Billionaire, but his company, which started as an online bookstore, revolutionized the publishing industry. Amazon makes their entire suite of high-quality digital publishing tools freely available to the public. Anyone can self-publish their manuscript to the Kindle platform under better terms than the traditional publishers gave any but the most popular writers.\n\nAs the story goes JK Rowling famously assembled her manuscript while working waitstaff at a cafe. Writing on literal napkins during her downtime bored at work (remember this was before cellphones). Her lucky break came when a publisher decided to take a risk on something different, a story about a mundane kid who goes to wizarding school.\n\n\nJK Rowling born twenty years later would probably post her hobby work to RoyalRoad or equivalent a chapter at a time.\n\nShe would grow a modest following as she built writing skills and open a Patreon. Ad-based users reading for free, with Patrons reading a couple chapters ahead.\n\nThe Patreon money would accumulate to a point where she takes the leap to quit her day job and write full time.\n\nThe quality would continue to improve and she would build momentum. At a certain point, she would finish a novel sized section. Then begin the process of editing, revising, and re-writing earlier sections with a much more experienced eye. Eventually it would get digitally published to kindle/e-readers/ect, either alone or with the help of Author-owned independent \"publishers\" who fill the role of reviewers. Successful digital authors often do print runs eventually.\n\nIn this parallel world, Harry potter probably doesn't reach the same level of Buzz, but that's because this new business model is supporting literally 10x the full-time authors competing on digital store shelves. She still probably gets fabulously wealthy.",

I was in London at the time, and it was *incredibly* fun. The queues, the media stories... and, above all, that weird sense of community that came from seeing lots of strangers all reading the same book. You'd go to any coffee shop, cafe - even on the tube - and it was a really joyously *communal* experience.\n\nPretty much every cultural and contextual factor that made that possible has now changed. We're much more fragmented in the way we discover and consume media. There are many, many more options. And there's also much more algorithmic cultural 'railroading'. People have a much larger variety *and* the media environment encourages us to stay in our lane. There are fewer cultural properties of any sort that are 'universal' to the extent that HP was at its time. \n\nIt is also worth noting that the retail landscape has also changed immensely. *Goblet of Fire* was 2000! Books came from bookshops and supermarkets. People queued outside of places like Tesco and Sainsburys. That made a huge part of the communal experience: you could visibly see how popular something was, and also be there with other people. Now, the vast majority of book purchases take place online, and via Amazon. You can have a book that outsells Harry Potter (hi, *Onyx Flame*), but never actually *see* anyone buy it. \n\n(Amazon UK had $40m in net sales in the first quarter of 2000. UK net sales in the first quarter of 2024 were close to *$10 billion.* Those are from their statements, with a bit of dodgy currency conversion on my part, so please check the math.)",

I informed him the book was available for him and he excitedly told me he‚Äôd be right over and hung up on me!

Many will tell you he has to really be surrounded by gays to even know the term. He was also grouching about how much \"faggotness\" was going on in the seminaries lol ... ALL THE WHILE doing the most any pope has ever done for queers. He officially made it fine for gay priests to well, be out, and allowed the blessing of gay unions (just not weddings). \n\nMany, many queers around me were joking about this, entertained by it, gasping \"Francis how do you even know this word?\", and generally saying \"I'll let him reclaim that word\". \n\nI'm sure many were upset, but don't let it go unsaid. Many queers out there judge him for his actions and saw immense progress in their community thanks to him, and don't really mind if he drops a slur in private lol. \n\nI'm queer myself, though I'm aroace so not \"gay\" in the sense of same sex interest. I'm also an ex catholic. So my opinion doesn't really matter, but I'm deep in very queer communities and saw the news drop live to people's riot and amusement. \n\nThe use of that word alone made a lot of non catholic queers more aware of his liberal Francis has been, because they'd had no idea about his reforms until stumbling on the controversy.",

It started to take off in public discourse [around about the time that conservatives were looking for a reason why getting rid of USAID was actually a good thing for the poor and disenfranchised](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/opinion/trump-usaid-evangelicals.html). (No points for guessing why; conservatives never seem quite able to resist anything that gives their politics a veneer of respectability.)\n\nCome on. You know damn well what was meant, and you know damn well that it's been [a talking point among conservatives for months if not years](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/22/nx-s1-5321299/how-empathy-came-to-be-seen-as-a-weakness-in-conservative-circles). There's no 'imagine' about it. You're being either purposefully obtuse or actively disingenuous in trying to minimise what a shitty statement 'Do not commit the sin of empathy' really is by pretending it hasn't been adopted by a worryingly large number of MAGA folks.\n\n>we should all try to be honest and clear when we making statements.\n\nWas that clear enough for you?",

          "text": "I also read this book as an adult and couldn‚Äôt really understand the hate, or the way it was taught to teenagers.  Most high school curriculums focus on Holden‚Äôs little brother, and the idea that Holden doesn‚Äôt want to grow up.  It read to me not like a story about Peter Pan syndrome, but an an expose about sexual abuse in upper class boarding school circles.  \n\nIt opens with his terrible prep school roommate making plans to rape a girl from another school Holden is friends with. We find out Holden left or was kicked out of his previous school because he witnessed the death of a friend, who either jumped or was pushed out of a window by a group of boys who routinely beat up/sexually assaulted their classmates and were never punished for it.  After realizing he can‚Äôt win in a fight with the rapist roommate, Holden leaves to Manhattan, and walks around projecting onto and resenting all of the people who, like the school administrators who covered up his friend‚Äôs death via murder or suicide, are pretending everything is OK when it‚Äôs not, ie ‚Äúphonies.‚Äù\n\nHe meets up with a female friend, who opens up to him about being scared of her creepy stepfather who is constantly hanging around the house naked when she‚Äôs there.  One of his old teachers sees him at a bar, takes him home to offer him a safe place to sleep, and then gets sexually aggressive with him instead. The only adult who enforces sexual boundaries with Holden is a sex worker he harasses and lashes out at, who correctly identifies him as a kid and tells him to go home. Throughout all of this, he keeps having flashbacks to finding his dead friend‚Äôs body, and intrusive thoughts about killing himself in the same way, jumping from a tall building, because he sees life as an unending string of abuse and suffering that ‚Äúphony‚Äù adults either enable or perpetrate.  \n\nThe title, the Catcher in the Rye, is about Holden finally turning the intrusive thoughts about his friend‚Äôs jumping suicide into a constructive fantasy of being the ‚Äúcatcher‚Äù who saves him, who stands at the edge of a cliff and prevents other kids from jumping off.  It‚Äôs still wild to me that people think it‚Äôs about him being a proto serial killer??? \n\nI think it‚Äôs clear in retrospect that society was not ready to talk about the endemic abuse in elite private schools that this book was talking about, but it‚Äôs still crazy to me that it‚Äôs become such a meme of a spoiled, hateable character.",

Death of a brother at a younger age, witnessing a suicide, and he alludes to sexual abuse in his past. \n\nOn top of this he has some sort of undiagnosed mental health condition, possibly bipolar disorder, or simply an acute psychotic episode.\n\nWe also are presented with a completely unfiltered view of his every thought and opinion and if we experienced this with most teenagers, it would be pretty unsufferable.",

I get the impression a lot of people, especially younger readers, think you're supposed to like or relate to the protagonist. If you read the book with that lens, Holden is annoying to a lot of people. I also think some people relate a lot to Holden at a certain age (it might even be younger - my most emo phase was when I was 12 or 13), but if you read it when you're too old to relate to Holden but aren't at a point where you don't need to like or relate to protagonists, it doesn't work for a lot of people, and I think a lot of people read it in that time frame. Instead, if you can see it as a character study or interesting portrayal of this character, you have a lot less reason to dislike Holden. It reminds me of Lolita in that way - obviously I don't like or relate to its protagonist in any way, but it's an extraordinary piece of writing. I imagine the people who complain about Holden Caulfield overlap with the people who think Lolita is any form pro-pedophilia, because even now a lot of people have a hard time grasping that you don't have to like or relate to the protagonist. So I think that's a factor as well.",

I've definitely also seen a lot of weird takes about how bullied kids 'deserve it' for not working harder to fit in, and I think especially a reader in their mid-20s who was a bit of a bully in school might find it psychologically more comfortable to blame him entirely for his isolation instead of untangling all the situational stuff that brought him to where he is in the book.\n\nI don't know many people over 30 I talk to who dislike Holden, because people over 30 can see that he's a neglected troubled teen venting his feelings.",

          "text": "I agree. I expressed a similar sentiment in a post a while ago.\n\nI do think people whose sole takeaway is that Holden is an annoying character have done quite a shallow reading. While he is certainly annoying and a hypocrite, he doesn't develop in a vacuum (unless you count boarding schools as a kind of vacuum). He absorbs something from the bitter, jaded people that he encounters, reflects them, even. After all, he's at the age where these impressions stick and shape one's outlook.\n\nCrucially, he's a kid overshadowed by the grief of a bereavement and the trauma of abuse (I read the scene with his teacher waking him up stroking his hair as indicative of some kind of abuse). With this context, we deeply empathise with his need for genuine connection and guidance and can look more kindly upon his abrasive qualities and broader disillusionment with other people.\n\nAt the end of the day, he's a kid who has been through a lot of shit. For me, the moments where the better angels of his nature shine through are more revealing than a bit of hypocrisy or the odd gauche remark. Choosing to be kind when one knows the cruelty of the world is the true revelation of one's character.\n\nAFTER-THOUGHT: I think focussing on his wealth, whilst interesting, somewhat undermines Salinger's aim. I think he is trying to speak to the universal experience of growing up. That search for certainty in an increasingly uncertain world, the sense of anger and betrayal when you find out the values you were taught to cherish are conspicuously absent from the world and that it isn't as friendly a place you once thought it was. These experiences happen to everyone, regardless of your material circumstances. I think his material situation does a lot to help the plot sail more smoothly but I've not considered it within the context of his overall character.",

          "text": "There are plenty of people in this real broad world and in literature who experience abuse and ARE NOT boring, whiney, stupid little bitches.\n\nThe two do not correlate.\n\nAs a character, you can be a whiney little bitch. You can be stupid. You can be immature. But if you are all these and boring, why would I enjoy reading about you?\n\nLiterature is full of flawed protagonists. Some are interesting to read, others not.\n\nTo me Holden belongs to the \"not interesting and irritating\" group. I hate the way he thinks, the way he talks, the way he behaves (his decision making is below average at best). I hate his immaturity. I was a teenager and I had teenager friends when I was young. None I remember was like that. What cave did Salinger live in? Has he seen any actual kids/teens?\n\nAnd I found the book boring, too. There is a kid. Runs away from school. Wanders around aimlessly, doing stupid things. Why enjoy that?\n\nI think this book either resonates with some experience or sentiment you have, or it doesn't.\n\nI could not empathise with him. He has 0 emotional maturity, and is ignorant and na√Øve.\n\nI also read it when I was in my late teens or early tweens. If I was 11 or 12 when I read it, it may have made things different. I think I would have been closer to his emotional maturity level and that may have worked. You know, when you feel very adult to yourself?\n\nFinally, as in my country this book is not mandatory at school, a lot of people pick it up after someone's recommendation. That someone often being teacher (my case) or some wise adult who do not always realise world has changed and that people read different books. What you end up with is a disappointing protagonist, boring story and dated world. It's not fifties any more. Teens have different issues and deal with them differently these days, even if they do stupid things.\n\nSo to me, there was also \"not what I expected\" factor. Not deceived but more like what the heck, why did you recommend this.\n\nAnd you don't learn anything from it.\n\nI liked \"Trainspotting\" and \"Ham on Rye\" so much more, for instance. The protagonists are horribly flawed in these but I could empathise with them.\n\nI don't know if this is a correlate/predictor, but I hate \"On the Road\" too. Stupid, good for nothing characters and absolutely pointless story.\n\nSince I read both n-teen years ago, at this point in my life I might read them differently. But I still harbour sentiment \"never again\".\n\nI feel like I should try harder - my country has some links with Salinger. But it's so forced, I hate it.\n\nSorry, I feel I did not explain it properly. But to me this book and this character is a visceral \"no no\".",

Yet, another pupil ('Albert' - I'll never forget that name) had spotted me doing this, and went over to our school principal to rat me out.\n\nIn a severe tone, I was then told by said principal that I was obligated to throw the book into the dumpster. So I did.\n\nSuffice to say that that was the exact moment I'd lost all faith in our educational system.",

We have a letter from one friar to another in roughly 1270's saying that he had met the inventor of spectacles in city X. \n\nOne thing I would say about Foucoult's Pendulum is that it can be a bit confusing and also not make much sense unless you have some familiarity with what you might call western esotericism, the mass of magic and religious thought which has formed over the last 200 years in Europe.

The book absolutely blew me away. Although in choosing this book I was deliberately trying to stay away from subjects that speak too much about pressing present-day problems, I found Name of the Rose to be surprisingly relevant    as well. Especially with the different Catholic factions, most notably the poverty ones hating and fighting each other off even though at the end of the day, the non-poverty factions just looked at them with the same contempt and ultimately killed them all anyway. Therefore while that‚Äôs not the central conflict, it certainly makes you thing what‚Äôs the point of splitting hair and going after one another anyway when as a whole your group is at an immense disadvantage despite having the technically moral beliefs? I think Brother William of Baskerville expresses this exact exasperation at some point.\n\nOne thing that pissed me off about this book was when I looked up the monks‚Äô origins to see their nationalities and where they‚Äôre from, google freaking spoiled the villain to me so I knew the baddie the literal moment he appeared and completely missed the chance to be surprised! The ending is quite devastating IMO, and it was so sad to see the main duo having to part their lives. You can tell Adso really sees Brother William as a father figure and Brother William is very fond of Adso. \n\nThis is an automatic all-time fave for me and immediately promoted Umberto Eco to my ‚Äúwill-read-anything-they-write‚Äù list. I have Baudolino and Foucault‚Äôs Pendulum laying around but I‚Äôm on a Russian kick right now so they have to wait lol.",

They had no bead on TikTok, and when I asked if they had any plans to leverage resources for reddit they gave me a blank stare and said \"What's reddit?\"\n\nThe Harris campaign had hundreds of field organizers spending hours upon hours upon hours a DAY making cold calls with our cell phones to get people to knock on doors. Most people did not answer, but about 80% of the ones who did assumed we were telemarketers. They kept insisting that phone calls were key.\n\nAnd my counter argument of \"Who answers a call from an unknown number in 2024?\" Was rebuked and I was told to \"trust the process\".\n\nWe had a person at each field office who was supposed to be in charge of all things social media. And they gave them no direction other than \"try to go viral\" and then eventually just made them all make phone calls too. It was so dumb.\n\nThe Democrats got beat because Trump was created by the internet and embraced it, while they were dinosaurs. The only reason Biden won in 2020 was because of covid and voting being convenient for once, and they convinced themselves it was something else.",

There are a million ways to nudge people to do things, like automatic opt in for retirement programs versus having to do the work to sign yourself up.

They say at some point in the book that it should not be used for nefarious reasons but I guess that message didn‚Äôt make it to these folks. \n\nThat being said, these techniques are used and people are completely unaware that they are being manipulated to make certain decisions or that their opinions are being influenced. And, they are willfully ignorant and defensive when it is brought to their attention. It would be a failure on their part to admit they are being unknowingly influenced. They want to believe they are fully in control of their world and opinions. It‚Äôs a paradigm shift to admit failure and that is something a majority of people are strongly unwilling to make, especially when it‚Äôs been made so visceral. These influences are touching people‚Äôs feelings of safety and security, appealing to basic fears - and those in control are banking on the flight/fight response being triggered. They want the fight to create a distraction - to stoke a class war, to create strife between what should be equals, to create chaos - so they can do things like manipulate the stock market or pass laws that people don‚Äôt have the capacity to see because they are so consumed with so many things.  \n\nOnly when people really start to understand how social engineering is being used against them can change start to happen.",
