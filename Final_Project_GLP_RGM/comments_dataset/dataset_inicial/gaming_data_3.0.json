I had started a new job doing tech support for dialup internet and had made acquaintances with a few of the gamers in the office. \n\nEQ was the first real MMO I had played, and everything was larger than life. I had no context for anything I was seeing. I had created a dwarf warrior I think it was and Dave from the office met up with me on his high level wizard. He brought me to North Ro, outside of Freeport.\n\nWe teleported to the spires there which was amazing and really captured the imagination. But what really stood out were the giant scarabs. I had no idea what they were except they were enormous compared to my dwarf. Dave--I wish I could remember his character name--casually blew them up in one shot and then even beat one to death with his staff.\n\nI have a ton of other really great EQ memories, but that's the earliest and most dear. The sense of wonder and scale from that time has rarely been fully recaptured since then.\n\nThanks, Dave!",

That being said the number of requests to aol/msn messenger, skype, facetime ect that I got in direct messaging was always intense.\n\nNow that I'm married it's a whole different thing. When guys find out I'm a chick and tell them I'm married suddenly is HIGHLY offensive to them. Like how dare I not be just single and waiting for them to come alone and sweep me off my feet. Lots of requests for \"just some pics, he doesn't have to know\" like I'd ditch a perfectly happy marriage for some random jackass on the internet.\n\nI've mostly transitioned to offline games, more because they fit what I'm into lately but I definitely don't miss the gamer dudes.\n\n\nAll that aside, I've met some really cool guys in most of the games I play who are just there to game. I feel like the nice ones probably even outnumber the assholes so while the gaming community is super fucking hostile, I think it's getting better (or I'm just playing games with less asshole.

The other thing to know, which properly frames the situation, is that the power distribution for a track like this is flawed. When you squeeze the trigger for both controllers, and there are two cars on the track, the power is distributed pretty evenly, but if one of the cars is knocked off the track or your opponent releases their trigger to break suddenly, then that power is instantaneously transferred to the other car and car number 2 sees a comparable boost in acceleration and velocity for the exact same applied trigger pressure.\n\nWhen I went to college I studied Electrical Engineering, and it makes sense as both tracks are wired in parallel, but at the time, it was just known as the method to knock your opponent from the track. Both racers accelerate so they are going as fast as they can without getting thrown from the track, then just before your opponent enters a turn, you drop your throttle and watch as your opponent now finds themselves accelerating into a turn.\n\nFor the rest of the evening my Father tried in vain to knock me from the track. He used every dirty trick he could, and because of the way the cars power were distributed, it often meant I could cause his plans to backfire. I'm sure it was only a few minutes that I held on, but to a kid my age it was practically all night.",

          "text": "I keep saying this to all my friends. What really needs to happen is for E3 to roll around. Let all the video game and console devs do their presentation. Then; when EA steps out, and only when EA steps out, people collectively 'boo' and turn their backs throughout the whole presentation. The only thing gamers can do short of buying absolutely 0 EA games (unlikely) which would tank stocks, is to show them their actions have reached a pinnical of disappointment for their consumers. That gamers wont even be bothered to be aware/present at their biggest yearly exposition.\n\nEdit: even I can't believe THIS is my top rated comment. I always assumed \"RIP inbox\" was a joke.\n\nEdit #2: Ok so since this is still a comment people are latching onto and I have access to my computer now, I guess I should make as few things a little clearer. I know it's all paid-to-clap press. Those people are paid to write 'best in E3 show!' 'Battlefront 2 made me cry!' '#newEAgamelooksdope' bias is part of their resume. 'Yes man' their label. My point is that it would have to get to that moment where even the paid to gold seal 'reporters' have had enough. Sadly, there will never be a universal ban on one publisher. For those who've been in a guild, it's common knowledge gamers rarely will work together for the better of the whole without having their ego stroked as the one. I would assume this applies double for trying to ban a publisher. At this point, all you can do is the single most damaging thing to a major corporation; and that is to tank their stocks. Their PR will kiss shit stained player ass and do it with a smile. That's their job. What we need to start thinking as a whole collective is how to make their stock holders and CEO's start applying rose red lipstick and considering their go-to tongue action move. This means, actively boycotting all their products. Which nobody will do. I'm favor of a comment I saw where someone suggested, as far as Battlefront II was concerned, attack Disney. I agree with u/roxwar. >EA doesnt own star wars, Disney does and if theres one thing Disney absolutely will not tollerate, its bad press surrounding their brand. You want to punish EA? Then you need to take to social media and tag disney in this shitshow and express your disgust at their assosiation with gambling boxes in video games obviously aimed at children.\n\nI'd assume Disney saw the EA stocks and figured they could do no wrong. Disney stopped selling magic and childhood dreams mid-80's. What the fuck do they know about fun and happiness (anybody who points to their theme parks have clearly never stood 4-hours in line for a five minute ride)? That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games. We must learn to adult as gamers.",

We got the game every year... always hype for the early release in September!  But then nothing in the game was ever improving, the game felt worse with each release.  Each iteration of the game felt like a dumb downed recycled version of the last.  Every year the game felt more random and we were losing actual control of of our players.  Frustration finally led to all of us not buying 17.  My brother tried the 18 beta and was like yeah nevermind I know why we stopped.  \n\n\nThe only thing they update and care about is their HUT bullshit.  Because people drop stacks to buy more and more card packs.   Our boycott hurts, I miss hockey, but I finally decided after 4 years of declining user experience it was finally time.  Maybe one day EA will release a hockey game again that isn't so focused on micro transactions.  Or better yet maybe another company can make a damn hockey game.\n\n\nAnyway we are much happier gamers right now living it up in Rainbow Six Siege.  Fuck you EA, and fuck you rammalammadingdong.

I probably spent close to a thousand hours playing Battlefront II with my friends back in the day.  It was our go-to game for sleepovers and hangouts because we were all such big Star Wars nerds.  When they announced that there was finally going to be a new Battlefront game, I was so excited.  I couldn't wait to rush out and buy it the second it came out!  It was going to be just like the beloved games of my childhood.\n\nAnd then it turned out to be a toxic pile of sludge.  I never bought it.  I won't be buying EA's Battlefront 2 either.  And the whole thing just makes me really sad.\n\nAfter the disappointment of EA's first Battlefront game, I discovered that the original Star Wars Battlefront 2 is available on steam for like $5-10. So I bought it, and I've pumped a crazy number of hours into it all over again with friends over the past year.  And you know what, the fun we've had with it has been worth every penny.\n\nFuck EA!",

In recent years he works less than he used to so when they released that PS4 package with battlefront and the darth Vader skin he bought it. Since the day he bought that he plays it for at least a while every single day he can. He could give a shit how it compares to other shooters, he doesn't care about shooters the last game he played on console was probably crash bandicoot. He doesn't care if it's expensive he has plenty of money and it's like the only game he has to pay for anyway. I guarantee you he already has the most expensive version preordered and he will drop a couple hundred on release if he has to to unlock everything. He doesn't care about video games or developer ethics, he just really really likes Star Wars, and the battlefield style gameplay and graphics really immerse him in the universe he loves.\n\nThis game is for him not you and EA knows that. \n\nThat's why EA bought the rights.\n\nThat's why EA could give a shit if redditors play the game, after the last release they knew half of us would shit on it even if it was perfect and none of us would spend any real money.\n\nIm not saying don't boycott but just know that every casual gamer who's a hardcore SW fan makes up for 20 of us each cost wise",

Know how many BACKSTOCK 360s we had? Over 1000. Yeah. That's how often they came in.\n\nGuess how many Wiis we had? Well over 500. That's Backstock too. This is not including what we had completed and ready to sell.\n\nSo guess how much we offered for consoles? 5 dollars. That's all you get for consoles with no cables/controllers. And yet people still sold it to us. It got so bad we started to refuse both Wiis and 360s.\n\nThe PS3 I wish I could see the other side because if it had 4 USB slots...we would have paid money for it regardless if it had cables/controllers but you would definitely get more if you did. Fat PS3s with 4 USB slots in the front is Backwards Compatible. That means it plays PS2 games as well ( all PS3s could play PS3 and PS1 games but only that model could also do PS2 ).\n\nSo what netted him the MOST were all those controllers. Everything else was because \"well I want those controllers so I'll pay a little for the rest to JUST GET THISE CONTROLLERS\".",

If people buy a game and it sucks, it still sold well which would be feedback it was good. If people sleep on a game due to previously mentioned public negativity and don't buy a game, that says the game was bad. This has created a situation where the people making games are unlikely to get clear, useful feedback.

          "text": "Question: are your kids sleeping in on the weekends? If not, I'm pretty sure I know what the issue is and parenting duties need to be more evenly split off work hours. Being a morning person is not the same as being the only parent in charge in the mornings and having to force kids to tip toe around a sleeping parent. Same issue would be going with taking care of the dogs. That's a hell of a lot for one person to be wrangling every morning on the weekends. This cannot be an every weekend schedule because it's likely causing a problem with your wife. Use your head for a minute and think about what always sleeping in on off days actually looks like for your wife. Sometimes, people want a relaxing morning, awake or not.\n\nAnd make sure you are very aware of noise levels when gaming while people are asleep. Wearing headphones is not enough- you need to make sure you yourself are not yelling or being loud. Especially with young children. If they are being woken up, that's another issue that can be setting her off. It's unclear if that's a factor in your post, so I'm mentioning it. Another consideration is are you putting the same efforts into maintaining your marriage as you are gaming, something else that sets partners off. \n\nPlaying games is a perfectly fine way to de-stress as long as you are balancing your responsibilities and relationships well. This also means being present and not tired when you are with your family. Normally, when a spouse is lashing out like this, something is not going right with the balance, so make sure you are sitting and communicating with your wife. This means listening to her and what is stressing her out, not just focusing on how it's impacting you and what's centered on you. These comments are typically warning signs something is not right in your relationship. Your wife is telling you she's unhappy. Listen. Then be willing to compromise here- there's actions such as revisiting gaming schedules, having some more boundaries on both ends, that cam make your marriage smoother",

This meant I didn't get the chance to decompress and have adult conversation with my wife after chores and dinner and the bedtime routine. Instead I'd go sit and play games instead. \n\nWhether it was my intention or not, the message my wife received was that I don't like spending time with her. This had all kinds of knock on effects. \n\nOf course I was oblivious to this. In my mind, I just hated TV trash and I work too hard to waste my evenings sitting on the couch scrolling through my phone when there is an awesome engaging hobby that I love in the other room. \n\nBack to you: You work all week then come Friday you are choosing to spend your Friday nights away from your wife. Afterwards you sleep in. A lot of your time that your wife feels she deserves is being given to that evil gaming hobby. \n\nIt's not right, it's not fair. But that's how she sees it. She'll deny it, but that's why. Also if she seems to be acting irrationally elsewhere, there's a fair chance it's just shitty communication and redirected feelings from this issue.",

She feels the way she feels and that’s what you’ve got to deal with so any kind of logical debate to try and change her mind is probably not the course of action and so having that discussion or debate here is kind of pointless.

This is something the two of you need to seriously discuss. What someone does for their personal hobby is up to them as long as it doesn't bring hardship on the family, as I'm sure she wouldn't want you to be overly critical of her hobbies either.\n\nGenerally, it showcases a possible lack of emotional intelligence for someone to criticize anothers hobbies on the basis of them being \"juvenile\" or \"unattractive\". For me, thinking that way is far more unattractive. Lots of dudes in their 40s just watch sports, which isn't all that more productive, but people should be able to do what they enjoy as long as it doesn't harm anyone around them. This is just my gut reaction though, without knowing her personally I think this is a deeper relationship issue that is just coming up through this criticism.\n\nThis doesn't mean your marriage is in jeopardy or anything, Reddit usually jumps to these conclusions often, but it is something you'll want to get sorted out amicably. Both of you are still individuals who should have your own interests, passions, and goals in addition to shared ones: and each person in a marriage should work to ensure the other can enjoy those things. This might mean compromise, but that is a two way street.",
