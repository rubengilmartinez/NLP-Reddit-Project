Eh, I don't know exactly, but words change. Language is essentially a living thing. It's never set. I suspect a word like \"terrific\" went from \"causing fear\" to \"so great that it causes fear\" to just \"pretty great.\" But this is *far* from the only word that's evolved over time, and more will do so, some within your lifetime.

Notice how 'doesn't add up' uses verbiage from math, 'to add (up)', which is probably where 'the math isn't mathing' came from. \n\nMath is very logical; 1 + 1 = 2, right? Well, take a hypothetical mysterious or difficult to understand situation. If it doesn't make sense, then 1 + 1 no longer seems to equal 2. That is when you could say 'the math isn't mathing'.

There are very specific cultural contexts where sir or Ma'am are expected, and using it otherwise can come across as passive aggressive. Only use it for positions of personal authority over you, such as your boss, and there are other forms of address you can use, such as \"officer\" for a policeman.\n\nGenerally, to be respectful and polite in English you just need to speak in a formal register.\n\nFirstly, use greetings. Say \"good morning\" before noon, \"good afternoon\" between noon and five and \"good evening\" after five. Or just the simple \"hello\" or more casually \"hi\". At the end of a conversation say \"Goodbye\", \"bye\", or \"see you\" and then when you're going to next see them, e.g. \"see you tomorrow\". You might make a bit of small talk to someone if it's appropriate to the situation. \"How are you?\" \"Great/terrible weather we're having, aren't we?\"\n\nSecondly, consider how you word commands, requests or questions. Use please when you're making a command or request that the person wouldn't necessarily do, e.g. \"please keep left\". Only give a command if you've got authority to do so. If you're making a request, word it like \"please can you help me\". It's normally more polite to say \"Would you like\" rather than \"Do you want\".\n\nWhen someone does something for you or gives you something, say \"thank you\" or \"thanks\". In return, say \"you're welcome\" or \"no problem\". \n\nThis is culturally specific to Britain: When you do something wrong, or something goes wrong, say \"sorry\". If you need to get past someone, say sorry, I'd you need to grab someone's attention, you might say \"sorry, excuse me\". If someone asks for something and you don't have it, you might say \"sorry I don't have that\".\n\nLastly, deeds are more important than words, and your politeness comes through in what you do, not just what you say. Hold the door open for people, let people through first.",

If I was dealing with someone who cared about social hierarchy and was \"above\" me I'd spell out \"thank you\" or even \"thank you for your time\".\n\nNote that some people like to have a reputation for \"plain speaking\" or similar and will claim to prefer that their subordinates speak bluntly to them. Sometimes they actually mean it, other times they think they mean it but really don't. Take your cues from others at your social level when speaking to such people.\n\nI've worked at a place where the owner really did mean it and vastly preferred us to straight up tell him that something was stupid bullshit if that's what we meant. I've worked at other places where the owner claimed to be like that, but in fact wanted some buttering up more formal type speech from us. So \"stupid bullshit\" might become \"not ideal\". \n\nCorporate speak, like \"leading to suboptimal outcomes\" can often come across as sarcastic, so be careful about it. Note also that phrases like \"as per my last email\" are widely known to have rude meanings. \"As per my last email\" means \"I already told you this you stupid asshole\" and should be avoided unless you mean to be on record as subtly calling someone an idiot.",

For the former, this comes down more to the use of ‚Äúplease,‚Äù ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù and other ways of interacting such as not interrupting or directly confronting someone. For the latter, there are specific rules around when to use ‚Äúsir,‚Äù ‚Äúmadam/ma‚Äôam,‚Äù and titles such as, ‚Äúyour highness/excellency.‚Äù \n\n\nAssuming you‚Äôre not getting invited to the palace any time soon, it really comes down to manners and deference. This is so culturally specific and based on each context, meaning UK is not the same as Australia (for example), and a tennis game with your girlfriend‚Äôs father is not the same as lunch with your new boss. It ultimately comes down to empathy with the person you are speaking with, and not coming across too brash or expert.",

Although I didn't major or minor in English in university, it was one of my two strongest subjects all throughout K-12, where I typically earned 98-100% semester averages. I minored in Mass Communications.\n\n# Example #1 of my writing *(fictional story/joke comment)*:\n\n> Once upon a time, there was a bursting, a thunder. Wisps of mystic chaos flaming and crackling, booming and roaring from out of a nearby wormhole. The skies of our world were lit with such force that the people below could only watch and tremble.\n> \n> So busy were they looking up at the skies, no one noticed when it happened. Amid all the madness and all the uproar, a new creature appeared in our reality. It was a child, a child from unknown realms. A child, but *who?*\n> \n> This, you see, was no ordinary person. Foreseen by the prophets, Equivalent_Ad1362 would one day grow to walk among us, browse the website known as Reddit, and somehow still have sex!\n> \n> Few could fathom how this could be, or what it might mean, but soon, very soon they would begin to see‚Ä¶\n>\n> ---\n> \n> **[üéß Hear my dramatic reading.](https://soundcloud.com/user-978770087/equivalent_ad1362-the-myth-the-legend/s-btotuGmYvAO)**\n\n# Example #2: The Letter *(Harry Potter fan fiction)*:\n\n> Dear Mrs. Dursley,\n> \n> I am afraid I must be the bearer of bad news. Your sister and brother-in-law are now dead, at the hand of a dark and troubled serial killer who has been terrorizing our world. In the attack, their home was also damaged, but the child! The child survived, thank heavens, with only a scratch upon his forehead!\n>\n> We are taking great measures to protect the boy, but he needs a place to stay, and someone to look after him until he is of age to attend our school. I now entrust this child into your care, and hope that you will raise him as if he were your own. He has your sister's eyes‚Ä¶ and her dying love.\n> \n> My condolences,  \n> ‚ÄîAlbus Dumbledore\n\n# Example #3: A Father's Love *(fictional poem)*:\n\n> From the gentle, tender smile with a glow in his eyes, to the warm comfort of his shoulder in the difficult times, there could be no hint of question. There could be no trace of doubt. Every morning to every evening, they were all he thought about.\n> \n> He would take her to the water park and race her down the slide. They'd go out and play on picnics. He would seek and she would hide. He took sight of all her talents, always championing his pride. And when at times she struggled, he would guide her through the stride.\n> \n> It was never any question. There was never any slight. He wrote love for all his children‚Ä¶ on his heart in black and white.\n>\n> Sarah, she grows older, and with each day she sees‚Ä¶ a new embrace of kindness, and what family's meant to be.\n> \n> ---\n>\n> **[üéß Hear my narration.](https://soundcloud.com/user-978770087/a-fathers-love)**\n\nI also partake in amateur songwriting and [voice acting](https://soundcloud.com/user-978770087/quenched-by-the-red-blood-of-my-enemies/s-NMgAP8A2s83)‚Äîtwo hobbies which directly tie into my English ability.\n\nI owe a great deal to my parents' encouragement, the authors of the many great books I enjoyed as a child, public libraries, school libraries, the Accelerated Reader program, Levar Burton's Reading Rainbow, and fantastic public schoolteachers like Mr. Witkov, Ms. McWilliams, and Ms. Bryant. Language is a powerful tool for creative self expression, and these people helped shape me into who I am today.",

Hopefully you're fairly far in your journey to learning English before you're covering this, but here's the problem:\n\n'always been coming here' uses the **present perfect continuous** tense. What does this mean? Present tense mean it's happening now. Perfect tense indicates that an action or circumstance occurred at a different time period (usually earlier) than the time under consideration. So since we're talking about the present, and it's *been* happening. It's in the past. That's okay. There's nothing wrong with this so far. Continuous tense describes actions or situations that are ongoing or in progress at a certain time; they're not completed.\n\nPutting this together means that he began coming at some time in the past and *has not yet finished* arriving. He's *always* been in the process of arriving, according to the statement.\n\nTo make this more correct, Cassie should have used the present perfect tense: 'Has he always come here?' To make it more correct, you'd typically want a timeframe or set of timeframes for reference For instance, 'Has he always come here for breakfast?' or 'Has he always come here on Christmas?\"",

To me, it does not.

Maybe it's because the word *always* with a perfect verb means \"continuously\" (\"We have always lived in Washington.\"), while with a progressive verb it means \"repeatedly\" (\"He is always making new friends.\"). When you try to combine the two and use *always* with a perfect progressive verb, it just doesn't compute.\n\nAlternatives to \"Has he always been coming here?\" (These each mean something different.):\n\nHas he always come here? Has he been coming here for a long time? Has he been coming here a lot? Has he already been coming here?",

Written English tends to use formal writing. \n\nI try to spread this around when I can, but there IS a difference in English between spoken grammar and written grammar, due to a lengthy history of elitism and servitude, so our written grammar actually reflects more grammatical nuances of romance languages (French and Latin specifically), in that romance languages have formal conjugations that are used regularly while English did NOT, however due to French/Latin being the \"language of the elite\" centuries ago, our english speaking ancestors changed a LOT of our natural speaking rules to match the grammar of these languages to sound \"intelligent\" (and be taken more seriously) when they exchanged letters and wrote documents.\n\nFor example, two common rules are: \n- Don't end a sentence with a preposition (with, by, on, etc). In spoken English we do this all the time, but it is considered \" ungrammatical\" in written English. \n- Never start a sentence with a conjunction (but, because, and, etc). Again, very commonly done in spoken English, but will have the grammar nazis foaming at the mouth in written English.\n\nSo while you are correct, because this is in writing, you're no longer correct. ((Fun fact, this is also why some of our spelling (specifically British English) is so confusing, our words were meant to reflect French spelling, which is notorious for being unnecessarily superfluous).",

It's a journey there's no real finish line here. There are a couple of very obvious yet effective ways to make sure you don't become rusty:\n\n1) Do some creative writing. Even Reddit itself goes a long way in that respect. It's a forum you can write a long-form reply to anyone on whatever topic. Dive into whatever you're interested in and hang around discussion forums. You'll be fine.  \n2) Read literature. It could be fiction, non-fiction, whatever. Audiobooks help too.  \n3) If you have friends who are native speakers of English just talk to them once in a while. It could be just chit-chat or deeper topics.   \n4) If you come across something you're not sure of while reading or listening to something in English always look it up. I do it constantly myself, it's a force of habit. I hate ambiguity in comprehension. \n\nThat's the best you can do, unless you have a job that's connected with knowing English then that's even better. Good luck on your future endeavors.",

For the last two years I was in an environment where I practiced my English skills every day, both in terms of communication and grammar, so I always was being challenged and my English was at its most fluent.\n\nThen I noticed that almost as soon as I left that environment those skills started to rust. Suddenly I'm using awkward expressions that when I re-read them seem off, I use a \"to\" where a \"for\" is needed, an \"in\" where a \"on\" is grammatical, etc. I also noticed my accent isn‚Äôt as \"natural\" either, certainly not as natural as when I practiced my speaking skills everyday.\n\n\nOverall I try not to worry too much about this tho, because I don't have an external pressure to communicate at my best now. Some things might fade but I think language proficiency is like riding a bike,  once you really understand it you never really forget it, even if you lose practice. I wouldn't worry too much if I were you either since C2 is the highest certification and it shows your skills are already at a very high level, most jobs or colleges will ask for a B2 level if they ask at all, so your level is more than enough.\n\n If for personal reasons you really feel you need to keep pushing yourself, maybe you could try joining environment where your skills are always being challenged as well? Discord servers, VC on online games, joining writting projects, etc. The internet is very American-centric so most English speaking communities will be full of natives. You could also give lessons if you have the time, both tutoring or in a classroom setting. You'll keep your skills sharp and make some money too! All in all, as others have pointed out, I wouldn't overthink it too much, English in its entirety will not evaporate from your head if you don't use it everyday.",

          "text": "As someone who also passed the CPE test, my experience is that the English needed to pass that exam won't probably be the one you use the most. It's unlikely you'll be using any fancy words or figuring out the order of a text from cohesive devices only anytime soon, so just have fun with the language! I'm a translation student and the things needed to pass that exam aren't even that relevant, the syllabus for the Cambridge exams isn't representative at all of what speaking a language really is imo.\nMy way of engaging with the language outside formal studies is using reddit tbh, the communities are fun and there's always some good tea available. You can read books, watch videos, change the language of your favorite videogame and see how the experience changes for you, basically anything you usually enjoy but in English! It is one of the most spoken languages after all so the vast majority of entertainment available is just around the corner, if you know where to look :>",

That way I can practice pronunciation, speaking and reading at the same time, which is my weakest part as passively consuming content is easy, but an active role in english is hard as sadly I have no one to speak to in english, so I have to make do. I guess discord exists but I just dont like it enough. \n\nUse your language and it wont rust.",
