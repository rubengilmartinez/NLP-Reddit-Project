It\\'s another in a long line of items politicians know they can say because it will sound good to people who don\\'t know any better.  Looks at how politicians talk about banks as another example.  They know most Americans don\\'t understand how banks work, and it\\'s politically popular to shit talk them, so they do it unendingly.\\n\\nAs for who, specifically, is gouging us?  Cargill is the largest beef producer in the USA but they\\'re private so I can\\'t see their Financials.  Let\\'s look at [Tyson](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSN) instead.\\n\\nFor some reason their fiscal year end is 9/30 so I\\'m going to look at 9/30/21 and 9/30/23 financials.  I pulled up their annual reports to help break some of this down.  I\\'m doing this on my phone so forgive the poor formatting.  Also, I don\\'t want to ignore wages here, but I think they\\'re either embedded in COGS or in SG&A.  Either way, they\\'re noted as increasing in each period, including each year from 2020-2023.\\n\\nIn 2021, Tyson saw $47B in revenue.  Of that, $18B was Beef, $6.3B was Pork, and $13.7B was Chicken.  $9B was \"other prepared foods\" which, idk.  They reported segment operating income of $3.2B in Beef, which carried a loss of ($625MM) in Chicken and a wash in Pork \\n\\nThat year, Tyson saw gross profits of $6.5B on revenues of $47B for a gross margin of 13.83%.  Operating income was $4.0B, and Net income was $3.06B, for a 6.38% Net Margin.\\n\\nIn 2023, Tyson recorded $52.881B in sales.  Of that, $19.3B was Beef, $5.7B was Pork, and $17B was Chicken.  The company recorded Operating deficits in all segments.  They lost $91MM selling Beef, they lost $139MM selling Pork, and they lost $770MM selling Chicken.\\n\\n\\nIn 2023, On sales of $52.881B, their Gross Profit was $2.631B, for Gross margin of 4.98%.  Operating Income was negative at ($395MM).  NET was ($649MM).\\n\\nTAKEAWAY:\\n\\nThis is an industry juggernaut, and they\\'re getting squeezed.  They\\'re not making record profits.  They\\'re not even profitable, because their costs have reached a level that they can\\'t continue passing on to the consumer.  \\n\\nIn their 2023 financial notes, they state that \"average sales prices increased slightly due to price increases associated with live cattle supply and input costs, whereas, operating income decreased due to unfavorable market conditions, including higher Fed cattle costs.\"\\n\\nThey\\'re not ripping us off dude.  They experience inflation too, and they\\'re struggling to sell the stuff at prices that can keep them in business.\\n\\nThis is the thing that gets missed with commodities.  When times are good, they make money, and when times are bad, they lose money.  Think of oil companies.  We didn\\'t mind in 2020 when oil futures went negative and ExxonMobil was losing its ass, but we freak out when demand picks up and they can sell it for a profit again.\\n\\nWe aren\\'t getting gouged.

Meaning, we need people to buy things because we don’t make them here at home.\\n\\nFor people to buy things, they need money. To have money, they need a job that pays them enough to do so.\\n\\nOver the last few decades, the money has been squeezed to the top class., partially due to how people are paid (stocks versus cash). \\n\\nWe have an economy that’s more “bifurcated” between the rich and poor, the lululemons and the Walmarts have become the market. \\n\\nThis can work for a while, but eventually that gets unsustainable. To feed the beast, you need people, more people to get paid and buy.\\n\\nA lower birth rate happens in many advanced economies, but is at least partially due to money, and culture.\\n\\nWhites used to be 75% of the population around 1990, now it’s closer to 55% and declining. We have a situation where the standing majority feels threatened by “woke ideology”, which is really fear that everyone is not like them/us.\\n\\nThat fear imo is driven by people who did the same thing as their parents, but cannot afford the same house and lifestyle they had. The fact this is happening due to corporations that are now larger than most countries, using a world sized labor pool and reducing pay at home. \\n\\nIt’s more nuanced and hard to discuss, coupled with the lack of critical thinking skills from our degrading public education system. \\n\\nIt’s easier for Fox News to blame crime and a crumbling empire on blacks and immigrants than question why service jobs and the loss of immigration have eroded the pay of everyday people. For example, my dad worked part time in nyc at a grocery store growing up, had full health benefits and could fully afford night college, which ultimately led to him getting a job as a soda pop truck driver in nyc, which then led to promotions into management.\\n\\nThese same jobs today don’t pay anything, and costs and lifestyle expectations have risen. More painful still is that these jobs are a ceiling. Few start as a Starbucks barista and go to management, those jobs are given to MBA students.\\n\\nIn all this rambling I agree we need more people to drive a consumer economy, these people aren’t being born into the financial squeezed white majority and they are threatened by a growing population of people of different color; and culture, that they identify with. We need to start agreeing we have a problem and get to pragmatic solutions, but alas we prefer to throw shit at each other like monkeys at the zoo.', 'score': 1193, 'created_utc': '2025-03-28T21:34:27', 'subreddit_name': 'Economics', 'thread_id': '1jm5nvb', 'is_submitter': False, 'permalink': '/r/Economics/comments/1jm5nvb/us_economy_is_facing_a_longterm_slowdown_crimped/mk98hf3/'}, {'comment_id': 'mkaflxk', 'author': 'mingy', 'text': \"I have a suggestion!

Simultaneously, the world is exploring various new trade agreements, and an underlying theme is the avoidance of US involvement. \\n\\nFor example, Canada has long had things like NAFTA. This not only was a trade agreement with the US, but it was also a huge barrier to proper trade agreements with the EU, china, etc. With NAFTA all but dead, we can now move on. Not only does this present new opportunities, but will also close the door to a future NAFTA as it was; even if the US checks into nutcase rehab.\\n\\nWhy would we want to have USDs as any part of trade between the EU and Canada?

Between Bush, Obama, and Trump, and Biden, we now have a reputation of flip flopping at the whim of every election.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*This is why I'm the opinion that the US Senate should pick the secretary of state, separate from the presidency so that foreign policy can stay consistent and apolitical from domestic issues.\\\\*\\\\* The candidates can be chosen from a short list of recommended candidates, made up of nominees recommended by senators, various department heads, and the president. It can be done via simple approval vote, so that anyone who abstains won't be counted, and the vote can move forward quickly without obstruction.\\n\\nWith geopolitics requiring decades of consistency, a president shouldn't have unilateral power based on 4-year long domestic atmospheres. The Secretary of State could be 2 year biannually elections by the senate, with the ability of the Senate/president to call for a snap election anytime. It would establish a bipartisan foreign position that can outlast presidential administrations. Both parties would understand \\\\*that they might not retain a 51 majority\\\\* in the upcoming midterms, which therefore justifies keeping SoS candidates widely liked across the aisle to outlast each Congressional session as well.\\n\\nThis to me is the best way to handle foreign policy, since most Americans aren't equipped in understanding the complex impacts to geopolitics in the modern world. The average American doesn't really care about foreign policy and doesn't consider it when voting for president. Despite the president having the \\\\*most\\\\* sway over the topic, presidents are chosen based for their domestic stance which has caused unpredictability for the US on the international stage. When most Americans don't consider world events within their range of concerns, it's better to let experienced experts to pick a candidate within a pool of experts to direct how foreign policy is addressed for long-term stratagem.\", 'score': 1, 'created_utc': '2025-04-04T07:52:45', 'subreddit_name': 'Economics', 'thread_id': '1jqqc26', 'is_submitter': False, 'permalink': '/r/Economics/comments/1jqqc26/senators_propose_congress_take_over_tariff/mlc99ni/'}, {'comment_id': 'mlbcsm7', 'author': 'lifeismusicmike', 'text': 'What if Trump was actually trying to tank the economy with massive layoffs.

Not just making jokes or talking shit on reddit. Things include but are not limited to:\\n\\n1. Vote and be politically active. Political activism isn't just the vote but the whole process. Every bit helps be it going to your local town hall, helping any campaign, or contacting your local representatives.\\n\\n2. Defy in every legal way possible: Put more in your 401K/IRA/Roth so as to reduce your taxes to the Fed. Donate (tax deductible) to anti-MAGA organization, pro-democracy orgs,  or donate to your local community. Realize capital losses against capital gains or earned income ($3K max per year against non-cap gains). Reinvest in your business rather than take profits. Work overseas. Etcetc\\n\\n3. Reduce spending with [hard red or MAGA states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states). You can just pay tariffs and buy from friendly countries even if they will not be buying our stuff. Yes Canadian whisky rather than Kentucky Burbon. Take trips to moderate or blue states if not overseas to friendly countries rather than going to deep red ones. A great way to spend locally if you're in a blue or moderate state. If you must spend in hard red states then do so in blue districts. Also I'm not saying to do 0 business with the rest of the country since that's impossible, but you can always go to Texas or Nevada rather than Kentucky or OKC. You can buy other products made Texas but avoid Telsa. \\n\\n4. Don't spend with GOP/MAGA donor companies for example Coke or Tesla. You can choose different brands or alternative. Certainly you don't have to pay for their brand premium and save with generic. Alternatively you can rely more on yourself, consume less, and/or work with businesses in your local community.\\n\\n5. Buy/spend what you need and cut unnecessary spending/consumption. Fed is paying 4% and stocks are falling. Do more DIY repairs/building (Trump wanted more Made in USA right?) rather than buying, spend more time with your family rather than on tiktok, spend less time on facebook but more with friends, do non-profit work for your local community rather than buying useless crap you don't need, invest in your health by working out or taking a strolling the park rather than drinking Budweiser beer, etcetcetc.\", 'score': 36, 'created_utc': '2025-04-04T04:06:38', 'subreddit_name': 'Economics', 'thread_id': '1jqyruh', 'is_submitter': False, 'permalink': '/r/Economics/comments/1jqyruh/fox_news_criticized_after_stock_ticker_removed/mlbk4b4/'}, {'comment_id': 'mlbr1uy', 'author': 'brianbot5000', 'text': 'We just live in runaway capitalism.', 'score': 5, 'created_utc': '2025-04-04T05:01:50', 'subreddit_name': 'Economics', 'thread_id': '1jqyruh', 'is_submitter': False, 'permalink': '/r/Economics/comments/1jqyruh/fox_news_criticized_after_stock_ticker_removed/mlbr1uy/'}, {'comment_id': 'mlbcqhp', 'author': 'judgingyouquietly', 'text': 'I like to think that “whore ass” was not a typo.', 'score': 13, 'created_utc': '2025-04-04T03:12:40', 'subreddit_name': 'Economics', 'thread_id': '1jqyruh', 'is_submitter': False, 'permalink': '/r/Economics/comments/1jqyruh/fox_news_criticized_after_stock_ticker_removed/mlbcqhp/'}, {'comment_id': 'mlcj3w5', 'author': 'bctg1', 'text': 'My goodness it\\'s fucking bad. \\n\\nThere\\'s a \"DEMS IN DISARRAY\" title at the top of the page and it literally just brings up a list of articles about democrats...', 'score': 1, 'created_utc': '2025-04-04T09:39:40', 'subreddit_name': 'Economics', 'thread_id': '1jqyruh', 'is_submitter': False, 'permalink': '/r/Economics/comments/1jqyruh/fox_news_criticized_after_stock_ticker_removed/mlcj3w5/'}, {'comment_id': 'mlbj61z', 'author': 'hoppertn', 'text': 'I really hope they will.
