This whole thing is a complete shit show. There is no \"skill\" to what he is doing. Literally anyone could just walk in with absolute power and eliminate. Even worse, by this time in four years everyone is going to see how bad this has been and probably have to rehire and reinstate these departments anyway. If Elon was doing this the \"right way\", when the pendulum of political power sways back the \"waste\" would be seen as a good thing and not brought back. \n\nGetting rid of NPS and Forestry employees?

Applied to today’s total workforce, this would imply nearly 2.4 million more jobs created every year under Democratic administrations.\n\nThe Democratic advantage is even larger in private job growth than it is for total job growth. Notably, business investment is higher during Democratic administrations, with investment growth running at more than double the pace than it does during Republican ones.\n\nAverage rates of inflation—both overall and “core” measures that exclude volatile food and energy prices—are slightly lower during Democratic administrations.\n\nFamilies in the bottom 20% of the income distribution experience 188% faster income growth during Democratic administrations.\n\nSo, yes, if form follows, we will go into another recession or even a depression, and it will take the next Democrat President to spend his entire terms in office straightening out the Republican economic mess once again.",

Here's some things to consider.\n\nTesla has made profit off their cars literally for one quarter since Elon took over (he didn't found Tesla, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning did that's why Elon is omitted on the wiki as a founder). Their money comes from reselling carbon credits to other businesses so they can look more green than they are. The rest all comes from government bail outs, which are 100% funded by the American tax payer. \n\nElon's other businesses aren't profitable. Twitter has never been and social media in itself is quite hard to monetize. Ads are the last line for companies to make money and Elon has alienated a ton of investors since buying it. Twitter made 75% of its profits in 2023 from investors, which was a measly $2b, down over 20% from the previous year.\n\nSpaceX, Starlink, Neurolink, Doge, and all his other pet projects all burn cash. None of them have any real products or revenue stream. Not legally anyway.\n\nHe's done stock manipulation and has milked crypto. All of which drained America's money.\n\nSo if he's worth $600b, and none of that has come from selling products to other countries (Tesla has never generated profit from its cars), the money all came from the American people. \n\nAnd now he's interfering with the legal and political system as well as using the presidency for his little 4chan memes and infuriating the world with racist gestures and epic gas lighting.\n\nI mean ffs, it's telling when anything he's ever talked about, a litany of professionals in the field collectively 🤦‍♂️",

A single month 2k payment wouldn't even be the largest stimulus in the past year, several months wouldn't even break it. And yet through this time of increased spending, stable inflation, we've not increased taxes but have had major tax code rewrites involving sizable decreases in corporate and top-tier tax rates, effective tax rates as averages have remained steady. \n\nFor everyone saying this would lead to cheeseburger costs rising or some sort of imaginary inflation are not looking at the numbers as they are currently.\n\n(Edit: apologies it looks like I overestimated some of the past stimulus packages, not several bills past 1 trillion, we're looking at several bills from 200 billion to 800 billion, not several different bills of over trillion).",

So under Trump, its been 3 months, and it's true the S&P has declined, but not perilously.  I think more time is needed, as every day it goes down but not dramatically.

Somewhere in between all of this, he started his own investment company that focuses on investing directly based on US interest rates, and it suddenly netted $5 billion in revenue. I'm just going off of what I read about him from various articles, and bios from where he has worked and/or spoken at (think tanks, etc), but this Daleep guy just seems like your standard govt profiteer. Unsurprising is how he worked at Goldman Sachs, and historically, former GS employees usually wind up filling the ranks at the Federal Reserve 🤔...I just don't think that I trust this guy to be effective, especially considering he also created the 2014 sanctions against Russia for the Crimea/Donbas invasion, which he testified to Congress were effective when they really did nothing at all.",

He was a long-limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money and was therefore wise. “As ye sow, so shall ye reap,” he counseled one and all, and everyone said, “Amen.\nJoseph Heller, Catch-22",

The triple digit and double digit taxes he put on imports means that business in the U.S. won't have parts/materials/goods to serve as inputs and hence businesses who based their profit margins on a reliable supply chain are being seriously hampered.\n\nSo, foreign investors see the supply chain disruption and recognize that COVID style disruptions are hitting America simply because its President want them to. They are pulling their money out since it will be hard to make money given such disruptions.\n\nThis is REALLY REALLY bad for an economy since who is gonna invest in a rebuild when profit is so easily disrupted.",

Rather, this feels more like people are liquidating their more volatile assets in order to protect themselves from the current turbulence, but i think it's unlikely that they don't invest at least part of that money back into the US eventually.",

          "text": "Call me crazy, but I suspect Canadian GDP and equities will outperform the United States over the coming decade. For several reasons. \n\n1. Lower interest rates in Canada (vs USA) will make it a more attractive investment destination. I expect interest rates in Canada will remain structurally lower than in the USA, due to Canada’s healthier fiscal position (lower debt), and USA’s weakening reserve currency status. \n2. Canada’s economy is heavily dependent on resource extraction, which is actually a good thing, since demand for resources are more durable than demand for services. In a recession, demand for fertilizer will be more durable than demand for Netflix and AirPods or whatever. \n3. We’ve learned from previous trade wars that it really does not take long for counties to find new trading partners. If the USA won’t buy Canadian resources, Europe and Asia will.\n4. Canada has had massive immigration over the past decade, which has recently depressed GDP per capita. But as those immigrants are absorbed into the workforce, and become more efficient, we should see them significantly boost per capita GDP over the coming decade. \n5. If the United States remains politically unstable, I expect many companies seeking serve the US market will locate in Canada, treating it as a politically stable safe haven.\n6. Expanding on the previous point: Unlike the USA, Canada does not have massive tariffs on its economy. *All else being equal*, this will make it comparatively cheaper to operate a business out of Canada than the USA.\n7. The declining value of the USD vs CAD and other currencies alone means that, *all else being equal*, Canadian equities will outperform their US counterparts. \n\nAdmittedly, this is a low-confidence prediction. It’s just one of many plausible scenarios that could happen based on current events. I haven’t yet bought any Canadian equities, but it’s a market I’m watching closely.",

This means that everything imported to the US from those countries will be more expensive on top of the tariffs just due to currency exchange, and the consumers are the ones that will get the brunt of it. I'm not an expert, but if it walks like a duck, smells like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's most likely a duck.\n\nBefore a tsunami hits the coast, the sea level shifts, and I think we are seeing the sea level move and the tide do weird shit right now.",

I also think that Trump believes power not exercised is power wasted.\n\nHe also doesn't believe in mutually-beneficial deals, everything's a zero sum game. Either you're screwing over someone or you're getting screwed, and since the USA is the most powerful country, they're getting screwed if they're not pushing everyone else around constantly.\n\nHe's an extreme narcissist so he's sensitive to opinion shifts though, and what he wants most are 'wins' he can tout. Actually achieving anything is unimportant compared to making it _look like_ he did. So he's pushing without a specific goal to see what he can get out of it. He probably does want to bring back manufacturing - but at the same time he'd easily abandon that goal in favor of an easier and faster 'win'. Hence the contradictory policy of claiming to want onshoring while also teasing trade deals, despite that undermining the former goal.",

I had no idea what was going on, and my first instinct was to sell everything to avoid losing more. Luckily, I had a more experienced friend who convinced me to hold onto my investments instead of panicking. In the end, I didn’t lose as much as I thought I would, and over the years, I’ve learned that these big drops are just part of the cycle. But man, those moments of uncertainty really test your patience and trust in the market.\n\nFast forward to now, and I find myself still holding through the ups and downs, but it never gets easier. Every time there’s a sharp drop, I feel that same panic rise, especially with how volatile things have been lately. It’s like you know logically that the market will rebound eventually, but emotionally it feels like you’re riding a rollercoaster. I’m curious if anyone else here has gone through the same cycle of emotions—do you all just hold tight, or do you make moves when things go south? I’ve been leaning more toward holding and diversifying, but some days it’s hard to stick with that plan.",

More people are divesting and pulling their money out with each volatile pump and dump.\n\nFor the first few pump and dumps it was like the market was searching for any sign of good news.  These days I think it’s largely resigned itself to a long-term downturn.  More people are more skeptical of “buying the dip,” and more people are betting against the market.\n\nPersonally I hopped out before liberation day and I’ve been exclusively trading puts for as much profit as I can.  I think anyone buying shares right now is basically asking for pain.  Puts might hurt too at times but I think ultimately they’re more likely to pay out, and I see every pump as an exit ramp for rational investors - with each pump being a worse exit ramp than the pump before it.",

In COVID I had dry powder and bought at the bottom so I’m still up significantly (25%). I’ve saved up cash again but had to wait a long time for this moment and have not yet bought in, I’m not convinced we are near the bottom at all. I think we will see another 25-30% drop by autumn as inflation kicks in in the states. Trump can’t back off of 145% tariffs and China is threatening to punish anyone in the region who makes a deal with him. \n\nNow here is where things get spicy, I’m concerned this time around that the US might not come back from this - when have we ever had a stock market crash caused by the unpredictable ravings of single leader. Never as far as I am aware. Other countries have had this problem. I also subscribe to the idea that T and his policies are a symptom of the collapse of civilisation that is underway so I am starting to think more locally and keeping my money in the place I reside rather than funding indirectly companies in countries with extreme protectionist measures.\n\nThis makes me think I shouldn’t be too heavily weighted to the states because I might not be able to get the investment back - for example if there was some protectionist block or tax on ETF distributions abroad or something like that. In some scenarios I could be looking at a total loss. So I think in the next dip I won’t be buying US weighted ETFs.",

The most likely culprit is high interest rates coupled with stagnant post-COVID real estate market.\n\nI would absolutely expect a spike of bankruptcies in 2025, especially if the tariffs are implemented as declared, but the data is not here yet. Even if tariffs are relaxed, federal layoffs and budget cuts should result in growth of bankruptcies.",

          "text": "This has several implications. The first and obvious one is that there is roughly 600 more people per week filing in 2025 so roughly 5-6% each week. This is before all the effects of the current administration show in the numbers and thus an indicator that many had been already plagued with too many loans to  begin with.\n\nBanks and credit card companies are usually insured against certain losses, so this will not have an immediate effect on them, but it might influence risk assessment of new loans. So it might get harder to get certain loans or they might become more expensive.\n\nThe second implication is that those filings are often used as an indicator for investors in terms of how healthy an economy is. So far we have had 'uncertainty' and ok numbers otherwise. These figures now change perception of those being deemed ok and a re-evaluation might take place. Since there is already pressure on several fronts, this is just another drop in the barrel of less enticing numbers.\n\nThirdly it could lead to those companies re-evaluating their overall credit risks, if this continues. It is one of the lessons learned from the last bubble (2008). One should also be aware of, that many a private debt has been re-packaged almost exactly as the house loans back in 2008. So there is a lot of private debt floating around, that has been made into securities and has been traded.",

But aside from the screaming clickbait headline, we really don't have the data to tell.  Note that the article points to data for the end of 2024 and uses that to infer for 2025.  And at the end of the article points to filings for 2025 average 10,288 per week versus the 9,687 average for 2024 -- but this is a trend that we have been seeing [since 2022](https://www.bankruptcywatch.com/statistics), and still represents two or three bankruptcy filings per 100,000 people per year.\n\nAs far as credit cards go, we just don't have the publicly available stats to really say much of anything yet.  The latest Fed stats are for 2024Q4, when 30-day delinquencies on credit cards actually dropped slightly (to 3.08%) - the next Fed report for Q1 should be interesting.  \n\nI have a very good idea of where things are heading in the upcoming several weeks or months, but at this point, there hasn't been enough time to really tell what's going on -- or more accurately the *magnitude* of what's going on -- since most of the stats are backwards-looking.",

          "text": "#Trump’s Tariffs Rattle Markets\n##Wall Street Sinks in Historic Slump\n\nIt’s barely been three months since Donald Trump returned to the White House, yet the US stock market is already in the throes of its worst start to a presidency in modern history. The S&P 500 has shed 15 percent of its value since Inauguration Day and that grim tally does not even account for the further plunge predicted as markets open this week. Traders are bracing themselves and with good reason.\n\nWhat began as a bull market inherited from the previous administration has turned decidedly bearish. And the main culprit, in the eyes of many, is the President’s economic playbook. Trump’s latest round of tariffs, unveiled with dramatic flair at his “Liberation Day” event, sent shockwaves through Wall Street. Promising a sweeping escalation of trade barriers, he alarmed the business world to such a degree that two-thirds of the market’s recent losses have come in the days since.\n\nThe timing could hardly be worse. The Nasdaq has already slipped into official bear market territory, as has the Russell 2000 index. The S&P is teetering on the edge. While markets are famously prone to fits of nerves, the speed and depth of this decline have drawn comparisons to some of the darkest days in recent economic history. The crashes of 1987 and 2008 and the COVID-19 shock of 2020 are all now part of the conversation.\n\nThis is not a case of inheriting a poisoned chalice either. When George W. Bush took office in 2001, the dot-com bubble had already burst, dragging markets down with it. Trump, in contrast, walked into a roaring bull market. In 2024, the S&P 500 surged 23 percent. Now, just weeks into his new term, the same index is spiralling in reverse and his policies are being blamed.\n\nThe tariffs, critics say, are acting like a tax on American consumers. David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors warns they are delivering a supply shock not unlike the oil crisis of the 1970s, stoking inflation while choking growth. That is an ugly combination for central banks trying to steady the ship. And while some Trump officials claim they aim to protect Main Street rather than Wall Street, the line between the two has grown increasingly blurred. Over 60 per cent of Americans have some stake in the market today through retirement accounts and investments. For them, falling share prices mean shrinking savings.\n\nConfidence is a fragile thing. The danger now is that tumbling markets will spook companies and consumers alike. If businesses put the brakes on hiring and expansion and if households tighten their belts in response to dwindling portfolios, the damage could spread quickly. Some economists are already flashing warning signs. JPMorgan now puts the odds of a recession at 60 per cent, up from 40 per cent just weeks ago. Goldman Sachs and HSBC have also raised their estimates sharply.\n\nThere is even talk of the US slipping into its first recession so early in a presidency since 1953. Back then, the country was just emerging from the Korean War. This time, the only war in question is the trade war Trump himself ignited.\n\nIf things continue on this path, what we are witnessing may not simply be a temporary correction. It could be the beginning of a far more painful economic chapter, with Trump’s policies at its centre. Whether the President’s tough stance on trade pays off in the long run is anyone’s guess, but for now, Wall Street is not impressed.",

That's a lot of terror that Mr. Trump needs to manage between here and there. I figure rats being what they are they will start crawling the walls over themselves when all they feel is fury and anger.\n\nNow that billionaires are being forced to feel the same pain as everyone else, I suspect this amps up the relative risk for Mr. Trump to either get his shit together because if he doesn't stop for his wealthy buddies he has to recognize he might well find himself on one of those weird moments where like some Russian or Chinese billionaire that discovers they can't fly as they are helped out of a 50th story window.\n\nIt would be unfortunate all around, but absurdly that's the risk Mr. Trump is putting himself and everyone else in.",

The other investment opportunities (like the spanish and portuguese ventures to the new world) were a lot more volatile because the rulers of those countries could just decide to take your money and not honor the debt.\n\nSo - what investors (and people in general) want are stable conditions to invest. How the fudge will you convince a person to invest X million dollars in an American factory if the next president (or even Trump) might decide to eliminate the tariffs, thereby changing the market conditions that made the investment viable in the first place. These things should be part of a cohesive strategy, with policies and a 10-20 year outlook. Not just a random guy waking up in the middle of the night and deciding that the stuff he heard on FOX news sounded great.\n\nEdited: Typos",

Just arbitrarily setting a 25% tariff is disruptive because the US doesn’t have the supply chain or manufacturing capacity.   It’s an enormous country with the largest market in the world.  You can move cars, electronics, textiles, etc here but it has to be phased over a decade.  “There will be a 25% tariff in 2035.   It will phase in linearly over a decade.”    You could get most things moved in 5 years before it disrupted the economy.  \n\nBetween automation and AI, you can deal with the labor cost disadvantage.    If you know your factory workers cost $25/hour, you design products that are suitable for automated manufacturing. \n\nWe’re still going to need to import off-season foods.  If I want cherries in January, they’re not coming from the US.  \n\nSo my take is that it’s crappy Trump implementation, not that the US can’t manufacture everything domestically and only import things where it’s impossible.",

The economy will grow. The country is sufficiently large and advanced that it has the resources it needs to get by without the need to trade. But will it grow as fast as it could? Will it maintain its position as a global leader the way it did? Probably not.\n\nThe difficulty is that these counterfactuals are hard to prove and hard for people to recognise. In the UK, people complain about the cost of living as if we didn't impose a lasting and significant weakening of the pound. Add in all the extra red tape for imports, and it's no surprise that the cost of living is up. Yet, people blame the government as if they didn't vote for it.\n\nI dare say the same ignorance of the facts will be true in America if this policy continues.",

At the time I wasn't clued on to his bs that much, but that gave me pause. Like he was already by any measure one of if not the richest person at the world at the time. His workers are who got him there, without the quality of their work he would be nowhere. What's he got to complain about? How much more could they have worked, to make him how much more rich? There should seriously never ever be a public statement by someone like him having a bad word to say about his workers ever. Did he say thank you? I don't know, maybe. But far out man.\n\nSame here. Trump is hitting all the US's former friends like an insane meth head, all the people who have helped the USA become what it is now. It's not 1950 anymore.

All the countries of the world can actually manage to cross one, quite big and significant in terms of market nonetheless, country off their list of trusted trading partners. They can manage.

Meanwhile if you're any business person in the USA, you now have a foreign market of countries full of pissed off people of varying decorum. Some understand that your leader is an insane person, some go on a bit with all this bullshit, many others either try to avoid you from here on just in case, or are openly hostile and specifically boycott you as a matter of principle.\n\nSo how's that going to lead to anything good? All the other countries are going to take that medicine, and focus on their domestic industries and closer trading partners as well. Again where does this leave the USA? Something like 300 million people expecting a modern economy they're not gonna get anything anymore when most of the stuff comes from other countries. As is the case with every modern country, there simply is not any one country that produces everything they consume. Not even China does, though they're much closer to that.\n\nJust you wait until countries declare sanctions and embargoes when Trump starts actual military aggression towards Canada.\n\nIt's all just so insane. It's all punishment for nothing.",

Sometimes it’s to “equalize trade” with other countries (not how deficits work), sometimes it’s to punish other countries, sometimes it’s to bring manufacturing back to the US, sometimes it’s to raise tax revenue for income tax cuts.\n\nThe thing is none of these things are congruent or consistent with each other. If it’s to punish other countries, then presumably when they do what we want they come off, and therefore manufacturing wont actually come back to the US. If it is to bring back manufacturing, then once manufacturing is brought back to the US how is it going to raise tax revenue if everyone is buying American and not paying tariffs.\n\nThat’s why these tariffs are so fucking ridiculous. There’s no rhyme or reason. It’s just trump loving to be in the news and see how his power can influence the global market.",

Can't remember which, but whatever.\n\n> It seems pretty clear after reading the work done by CEA chair Stephen Miran and the content of the signal chat from WhiskeyGate that this administration is filled with true believers. Most of the economic guidance is coming from MBAs, Finance folks, and Crypto bros. They seem to think what they are doing is coherent and will lead to some sort of long-term economic improvement in spite of all the evidence and overwhelming dissent of nearly all Economists of note globally.\n\n> If you take this along with the absolute brain dead bullshit from DOGE it's increasing clear that we are being ran into the ground by the equivalent of Mckinsey/BCG/PWC. I have worked at companies with leadership like this multiple times in my career. They are masters of deflection and will start throwing each other under the bus as numbers and popular support turn on the admin.\n\n> Most of those companies never recovered or took years and drastic action to dig out. If everything stopped right now and we started fixing things immediately we would still have multiple quarters of contraction waiting for us. This is going to be a generation defining disaster and will most definitely lead to our country becoming permanently poorer. The modern GOP is a legitimate cancer and it just spread to the lymph nodes. It might be terminal before the midterms.\n\nThe problem is that McKinsey/BCG/PWC types also happen to run Wall Street and most executive board rooms. Or, to put it bluntly:\n\nThe people in charge of most major businesses are fucking morons. At best, they can only plan two quarters in advance - and all they know how to do is maximize profit in that timeframe to the detriment to the future past that time. \n\nOccasionally you get a smarter consultant who will tell them something calming, like how a market correction is supposed to happen with a certain regularity. That calms the board room types such that they don't panic when they watch Trump crash Wall Street and erase 6 months of gains in 30 days - the consultants say this is normal, so they're okay. \n\nBut they're still too stupid to realize that this is much, MUCH more like we've been flashed with an acute dose of radiation and we're dead already. In that analogy, we're in the \"Latent Period\", when all of the initial symptoms have abated and we're feeling better - the market still doesn't look great, but things haven't gone to shit yet...\n\nYet anyone who actually knows anything about radiation sickness (or what Trump is doing to the economy) knows that the worst is yet to come, and that the Latent Period is the calm before the storm.",

Why view things at a macro level when you believe it will profit you in the short run?\n\n- **Trump is a literal cult leader**. Literally. His die hard fans worship him like he’s Jesus.

I tried to explain tariffs to her, but she believed Trump when he said the exporting country will pay the tariff to the importing country.",
