This whole thing is a complete shit show. There is no \"skill\" to what he is doing. Literally anyone could just walk in with absolute power and eliminate. Even worse, by this time in four years everyone is going to see how bad this has been and probably have to rehire and reinstate these departments anyway. If Elon was doing this the \"right way\", when the pendulum of political power sways back the \"waste\" would be seen as a good thing and not brought back. \n\nGetting rid of NPS and Forestry employees?

Applied to today’s total workforce, this would imply nearly 2.4 million more jobs created every year under Democratic administrations.\n\nThe Democratic advantage is even larger in private job growth than it is for total job growth. Notably, business investment is higher during Democratic administrations, with investment growth running at more than double the pace than it does during Republican ones.\n\nAverage rates of inflation—both overall and “core” measures that exclude volatile food and energy prices—are slightly lower during Democratic administrations.\n\nFamilies in the bottom 20% of the income distribution experience 188% faster income growth during Democratic administrations.\n\nSo, yes, if form follows, we will go into another recession or even a depression, and it will take the next Democrat President to spend his entire terms in office straightening out the Republican economic mess once again.",

Here's some things to consider.\n\nTesla has made profit off their cars literally for one quarter since Elon took over (he didn't found Tesla, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning did that's why Elon is omitted on the wiki as a founder). Their money comes from reselling carbon credits to other businesses so they can look more green than they are. The rest all comes from government bail outs, which are 100% funded by the American tax payer. \n\nElon's other businesses aren't profitable. Twitter has never been and social media in itself is quite hard to monetize. Ads are the last line for companies to make money and Elon has alienated a ton of investors since buying it. Twitter made 75% of its profits in 2023 from investors, which was a measly $2b, down over 20% from the previous year.\n\nSpaceX, Starlink, Neurolink, Doge, and all his other pet projects all burn cash. None of them have any real products or revenue stream. Not legally anyway.\n\nHe's done stock manipulation and has milked crypto. All of which drained America's money.\n\nSo if he's worth $600b, and none of that has come from selling products to other countries (Tesla has never generated profit from its cars), the money all came from the American people. \n\nAnd now he's interfering with the legal and political system as well as using the presidency for his little 4chan memes and infuriating the world with racist gestures and epic gas lighting.\n\nI mean ffs, it's telling when anything he's ever talked about, a litany of professionals in the field collectively 🤦‍♂️",

A single month 2k payment wouldn't even be the largest stimulus in the past year, several months wouldn't even break it. And yet through this time of increased spending, stable inflation, we've not increased taxes but have had major tax code rewrites involving sizable decreases in corporate and top-tier tax rates, effective tax rates as averages have remained steady. \n\nFor everyone saying this would lead to cheeseburger costs rising or some sort of imaginary inflation are not looking at the numbers as they are currently.\n\n(Edit: apologies it looks like I overestimated some of the past stimulus packages, not several bills past 1 trillion, we're looking at several bills from 200 billion to 800 billion, not several different bills of over trillion).",

Sure some percent will but with the latest border changes and finger printing Canadians staying over 30 days what’s the incentive?  \n\nWith the 2026 games coming it’s bound to be boycotted. That said I feel the current administration thinks short term pain is worth it. \n\nTo me it’s aligned with what Argentina and Milei has done. Same playbook with a new Russia spin.\n\nI’m not sure however the angle that Milei used would translate at all to the US.",

          "text": "How do you implement something like this? Grocery retailers have large margins on some items and will say it's to offset the negative margins in compete items. It also can't just start and end with grocery retailers, you then have to implement some sort of policy on meat packers (something like 77% of fresh meat is distributed by only 3-4 players). Packers are the ones that will always make the money. With these giant food conglomerates they have too much power on if/how retailers can compete on a price point.\n\nEdit: I want to point out that I am not in any way against finding a way to limit and control price gauging on necessary products like food. I am just wondering how the hell you actually implement policy and how can you prove something like that. Grocery is notorious for having extremely low margins and the industry as a whole is hyper competitive. Sure, there are regions with nearly zero competition, but the same scapegoat that is used with products will be used. We lose money here and make it up over there so as a whole we can have competitive prices.",

          "text": "I typed up a reply to someone in the r/inthenews thread on this article that was on top of All earlier today.  That thread locked comments before i finished this reply, and that made me feel bad, so I'm gonna repost it here.  The article specifically mentioned price gouging in meat so I went in that direction.\n\n-\n\nIt's just rabblerousing.  It's another in a long line of items politicians know they can say because it will sound good to people who don't know any better.  Looks at how politicians talk about banks as another example.  They know most Americans don't understand how banks work, and it's politically popular to shit talk them, so they do it unendingly.\n\nAs for who, specifically, is gouging us?  Cargill is the largest beef producer in the USA but they're private so I can't see their Financials.  Let's look at [Tyson](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSN) instead.\n\nFor some reason their fiscal year end is 9/30 so I'm going to look at 9/30/21 and 9/30/23 financials.  I pulled up their annual reports to help break some of this down.  I'm doing this on my phone so forgive the poor formatting.  Also, I don't want to ignore wages here, but I think they're either embedded in COGS or in SG&A.  Either way, they're noted as increasing in each period, including each year from 2020-2023.\n\nIn 2021, Tyson saw $47B in revenue.  Of that, $18B was Beef, $6.3B was Pork, and $13.7B was Chicken.  $9B was \"other prepared foods\" which, idk.  They reported segment operating income of $3.2B in Beef, which carried a loss of ($625MM) in Chicken and a wash in Pork \n\nThat year, Tyson saw gross profits of $6.5B on revenues of $47B for a gross margin of 13.83%.  Operating income was $4.0B, and Net income was $3.06B, for a 6.38% Net Margin.\n\nIn 2023, Tyson recorded $52.881B in sales.  Of that, $19.3B was Beef, $5.7B was Pork, and $17B was Chicken.  The company recorded Operating deficits in all segments.  They lost $91MM selling Beef, they lost $139MM selling Pork, and they lost $770MM selling Chicken.\n\n\nIn 2023, On sales of $52.881B, their Gross Profit was $2.631B, for Gross margin of 4.98%.  Operating Income was negative at ($395MM).  NET was ($649MM).\n\nTAKEAWAY:\n\nThis is an industry juggernaut, and they're getting squeezed.  They're not making record profits.  They're not even profitable, because their costs have reached a level that they can't continue passing on to the consumer.  \n\nIn their 2023 financial notes, they state that \"average sales prices increased slightly due to price increases associated with live cattle supply and input costs, whereas, operating income decreased due to unfavorable market conditions, including higher Fed cattle costs.\"\n\nThey're not ripping us off dude.  They experience inflation too, and they're struggling to sell the stuff at prices that can keep them in business.\n\nThis is the thing that gets missed with commodities.  When times are good, they make money, and when times are bad, they lose money.  Think of oil companies.  We didn't mind in 2020 when oil futures went negative and ExxonMobil was losing its ass, but we freak out when demand picks up and they can sell it for a profit again.\n\nWe aren't getting gouged.  We are living through a difficult economic cycle that hasn't finished playing out.",

Blaming corporations for inflation was always idiotic and like blaming the trees for the forest fire. It's not the tree's fault it lights up, it's the arsonist's. Corporations do not create inflation themselves and their prices aren't based on cycles of charity and greed. \n\nTHE FED poured money on the economy and inflated everything. In fact corporate profits have gone up  by about  the same ratio as the M2.  Corporations and workers only reacted in the only suitable way when there's more money in the system but the same stuff to buy.  \n\nAs for Kamala Harris, if she continues in this direction, then the Venezuela accusations will be most deserved.",

Reich tells us the real and different story below. Unfortunately, mainstream media like the NYTimes consults conservative economists as ultimate authorities.  They are not!  Many conservative economists (eg Larry Summers) get paid very large sums of money from the tycoons to advocate laissez faire capitalism without attending to its consequences.  Albertson's merger with Kroger which is under scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission, is clear evidence that laissez-faire economics ends in monopoly.  Only the billionaires profit from monopoly and gaming the system to avoid paying taxes.  Here is what Robert Reich, a distinguished economist, says:\n\n\"\n\n**1. Food prices remain high because there’s little to no competition across the entire food supply chain.** This has allowed big corporations to engage in a price gouging free-for-all.\n\nFour companies control most food industries, allowing them to coordinate prices instead of compete on the basis of lower prices.\n\n||\n||\n|||",

The other investment opportunities (like the spanish and portuguese ventures to the new world) were a lot more volatile because the rulers of those countries could just decide to take your money and not honor the debt.\n\nSo - what investors (and people in general) want are stable conditions to invest. How the fudge will you convince a person to invest X million dollars in an American factory if the next president (or even Trump) might decide to eliminate the tariffs, thereby changing the market conditions that made the investment viable in the first place. These things should be part of a cohesive strategy, with policies and a 10-20 year outlook. Not just a random guy waking up in the middle of the night and deciding that the stuff he heard on FOX news sounded great.\n\nEdited: Typos",

Just arbitrarily setting a 25% tariff is disruptive because the US doesn’t have the supply chain or manufacturing capacity.   It’s an enormous country with the largest market in the world.  You can move cars, electronics, textiles, etc here but it has to be phased over a decade.  “There will be a 25% tariff in 2035.   It will phase in linearly over a decade.”    You could get most things moved in 5 years before it disrupted the economy.  \n\nBetween automation and AI, you can deal with the labor cost disadvantage.    If you know your factory workers cost $25/hour, you design products that are suitable for automated manufacturing. \n\nWe’re still going to need to import off-season foods.  If I want cherries in January, they’re not coming from the US.  \n\nSo my take is that it’s crappy Trump implementation, not that the US can’t manufacture everything domestically and only import things where it’s impossible.",

The economy will grow. The country is sufficiently large and advanced that it has the resources it needs to get by without the need to trade. But will it grow as fast as it could? Will it maintain its position as a global leader the way it did? Probably not.\n\nThe difficulty is that these counterfactuals are hard to prove and hard for people to recognise. In the UK, people complain about the cost of living as if we didn't impose a lasting and significant weakening of the pound. Add in all the extra red tape for imports, and it's no surprise that the cost of living is up. Yet, people blame the government as if they didn't vote for it.\n\nI dare say the same ignorance of the facts will be true in America if this policy continues.",

This reminds me of the time in 2020 or so when Elon Musk was shitting on his workers constantly about needing to isolate and having a big laugh to slave drivers in sweatshops how his workers barely even work. At the time I wasn't clued on to his bs that much, but that gave me pause. Like he was already by any measure one of if not the richest person at the world at the time. His workers are who got him there, without the quality of their work he would be nowhere. What's he got to complain about? How much more could they have worked, to make him how much more rich? There should seriously never ever be a public statement by someone like him having a bad word to say about his workers ever. Did he say thank you? I don't know, maybe. But far out man.\n\nSame here. Trump is hitting all the US's former friends like an insane meth head, all the people who have helped the USA become what it is now. It's not 1950 anymore. The rest of the world has the rest of the world to communicate, collaborate, trade and develop together. All the countries of the world can actually manage to cross one, quite big and significant in terms of market nonetheless, country off their list of trusted trading partners. They can manage. It really sucks so bad, but they can manage. But the USA has now crossed the entire world off their list. Meanwhile if you're any business person in the USA, you now have a foreign market of countries full of pissed off people of varying decorum. Some understand that your leader is an insane person, some go on a bit with all this bullshit, many others either try to avoid you from here on just in case, or are openly hostile and specifically boycott you as a matter of principle.\n\nSo how's that going to lead to anything good? All the other countries are going to take that medicine, and focus on their domestic industries and closer trading partners as well. Again where does this leave the USA? Something like 300 million people expecting a modern economy they're not gonna get anything anymore when most of the stuff comes from other countries. As is the case with every modern country, there simply is not any one country that produces everything they consume. Not even China does, though they're much closer to that.\n\nJust you wait until countries declare sanctions and embargoes when Trump starts actual military aggression towards Canada.\n\nIt's all just so insane. It's all punishment for nothing.",

Sometimes it’s to “equalize trade” with other countries (not how deficits work), sometimes it’s to punish other countries, sometimes it’s to bring manufacturing back to the US, sometimes it’s to raise tax revenue for income tax cuts.\n\nThe thing is none of these things are congruent or consistent with each other. If it’s to punish other countries, then presumably when they do what we want they come off, and therefore manufacturing wont actually come back to the US. If it is to bring back manufacturing, then once manufacturing is brought back to the US how is it going to raise tax revenue if everyone is buying American and not paying tariffs.\n\nThat’s why these tariffs are so fucking ridiculous. There’s no rhyme or reason. It’s just trump loving to be in the news and see how his power can influence the global market.",

In turn, American companies will be able to raise their prices—just enough to stay below the cost of the now more expensive imported alternatives—because there is less competition in the market.\n\nAs a result, the revenue from tariffs will decline, since fewer imported goods will be sold.\n\nThe same issue arises if foreign companies decide to move their production to the U.S.—assuming they even do so. Relocating production can take 10 to 15 years, while Trump would only be in office for four years. So again, tariff income would decrease over time, but the damage—higher prices, less competition—would already be done.\n\nSo higher prices are to be expected in any scenario without having any economical benefits. \n\nAnd also not more employment will be generated because there is more automation on one side and they won’t return to the rust belt but where the employment rules are less strict.",

Republicans have been wanting to convert income tax into a federal sales tax for years because it forces a larger proportion of taxes on the bottom half of earners. The bottom 50% of earners in the US pay close to 0% of the federal income tax. However a federal sales tax would be a death knell for whatever party actually passed it, so they’ve shrouded a federal sales tax in tariffs. Consumers will end up paying that tax but they won’t see it on their receipts so there’s less association with what it is. Then they will pass more sweeping cuts for the top 10% but their base is too stupid to realize that won’t positively impact them in any way. They’ll just hear “tax cuts” and assume that means they pay less taxes, but they’re not getting any cut to their taxes and will be paying for the tariffs on top of it.",

He uses the term like reciprocal tariffs and you saw the figures like with China from Trump.  Are his numbers right?\n\nWith that said and here is the question...\n\nWith global business and let's say I am Apple corp in the US for this discussion.  Apple wants to work with China to put Chinese computer parts in Apple devices for sale.   And mass import these products.  I assume there is negotiation on price of the products for Apple to purchase.  Apple has the money and this Chinese company has the parts.   \n\nDoes Trump just believe that China or the Chinese company is jerking American companies around like Apple?  Does that happen?  Also, aren't there other taxes that the Chinese company have to pay just to get their product into the US.  Don't they have to pay certain port taxes?  Or state taxes?  I just can't imagine that this Chinese company \"Star Trek teleport\" the product to the US without paying any kind of transportation fee.   \n\nIf Trump and America want money for these transactions, why not just charge more corporate taxes.  It seems there is more targeted approach to collecting these fees than to arbitrary target all countries.",

What about American businesses, most of them, that rely on supply chain of imports? You think they will somehow switch gears and buy american parts that are not even being built yet?  I mean how many small businesses can survive this? They try passing down the cost of tariffs to customers only to depress demand and you can take it from there.",

          "text": "Interesting article, but I think it didn’t hit on why this is happening and what it means in larger context.\n\nWe are a consumer economy. Meaning, we need people to buy things because we don’t make them here at home.\n\nFor people to buy things, they need money. To have money, they need a job that pays them enough to do so.\n\nOver the last few decades, the money has been squeezed to the top class., partially due to how people are paid (stocks versus cash). \n\nWe have an economy that’s more “bifurcated” between the rich and poor, the lululemons and the Walmarts have become the market. \n\nThis can work for a while, but eventually that gets unsustainable. To feed the beast, you need people, more people to get paid and buy.\n\nA lower birth rate happens in many advanced economies, but is at least partially due to money, and culture.\n\nWhites used to be 75% of the population around 1990, now it’s closer to 55% and declining. We have a situation where the standing majority feels threatened by “woke ideology”, which is really fear that everyone is not like them/us.\n\nThat fear imo is driven by people who did the same thing as their parents, but cannot afford the same house and lifestyle they had. The fact this is happening due to corporations that are now larger than most countries, using a world sized labor pool and reducing pay at home. \n\nIt’s more nuanced and hard to discuss, coupled with the lack of critical thinking skills from our degrading public education system. \n\nIt’s easier for Fox News to blame crime and a crumbling empire on blacks and immigrants than question why service jobs and the loss of immigration have eroded the pay of everyday people. For example, my dad worked part time in nyc at a grocery store growing up, had full health benefits and could fully afford night college, which ultimately led to him getting a job as a soda pop truck driver in nyc, which then led to promotions into management.\n\nThese same jobs today don’t pay anything, and costs and lifestyle expectations have risen. More painful still is that these jobs are a ceiling. Few start as a Starbucks barista and go to management, those jobs are given to MBA students.\n\nIn all this rambling I agree we need more people to drive a consumer economy, these people aren’t being born into the financial squeezed white majority and they are threatened by a growing population of people of different color; and culture, that they identify with. We need to start agreeing we have a problem and get to pragmatic solutions, but alas we prefer to throw shit at each other like monkeys at the zoo.",

          "text": "My belief is the US debt has not been national debt, but world debt.\n\nThis is because of the USD as a world reserve currency.\n\nIf the world begins to move away from this, then the US debt simply becomes US national debt. \n\nPeople try to say that there is no other reserve currency, but the reality is that with modern computer transactions capabilities, there are all kinds of easy ways to structure international deals and how that money moves amongst countries.\n\nAs trade to and from the US slows down, there is going to be a drastically reduced appetite for USD and various treasuries.  Simultaneously, the world is exploring various new trade agreements, and an underlying theme is the avoidance of US involvement. \n\nFor example, Canada has long had things like NAFTA. This not only was a trade agreement with the US, but it was also a huge barrier to proper trade agreements with the EU, china, etc. With NAFTA all but dead, we can now move on. Not only does this present new opportunities, but will also close the door to a future NAFTA as it was; even if the US checks into nutcase rehab.\n\nWhy would we want to have USDs as any part of trade between the EU and Canada? Why would we want to continue to use swift, were the US can spy on these transactions (for the children, of course)?\n\nThis also includes various embargos, etc. Most countries have no problem with countries like CUBA and are uninterested in US policy. Before the US could bully the world into compliance, but now, they are bullying anyway, so that loses any weight.\n\nI see a bright future for the post US world. In most ways, the more the US collapses financially, the less of a temptation it will be for the world to return to a state of US domination.\n\nWhat we all need to do is focus heavily on cutting off all tech ties and dependency with the US; as this is both a source of strength, and finances for the US.\n\nThis could immediately start with facebook and other socials, including reddit. Also, include ever increasing taxes on google, apple, microsoft, etc. This way, companies would have a few years to find replacements, and time for replacements to ramp up. Also, kill software and algo patents in the rest of the western world. \n\nThen, tax the crap out of US media; ranging from a Fox tax, to ever increasing movie, TV, music, etc taxes. Just make their cultural noise go away. Many might torrent, but at least there is no more revenue for the US from that crap.",

Then who is liable? Tesla? Good luck.

Internships, clubs, leadership activities are all very important when you apply for higher paying jobs. An English major or philosophy major isn’t really worth the student loans, but if you get a degree in STEM you have more opportunities. In addition, young people need to know how to work efficiently, communicate better and realize that high paying jobs still require hard work and extra hours. You still have to start near the bottom.

The left has been trying for years to convince the right to acknowledge class as the actual point of bifurcation and the wealthy as the force that is driving it. All they do is plug their ears and whine about “Marxism”. It’d be great not to have to clash over culture, but when it becomes a matter of preventing suicides because there are increasing bills/laws on the books to ban or criminalize anything that isn’t 100% hetero, I can’t rightly criticize those people for fighting the fights that are brought to their doors. Or when cops still wantonly kill a disproportionate number of black people in the line of duty, I can’t fault them for fighting that battle either. Like, this isn’t conflict people are inventing for no reason. They’re trying to exist like anyone else, and a faction of the country believes it’s something to debate exactly because it doesn’t directly affect them. \n\nSo, while culture might distract from those larger economic concerns, it’s also an understandable struggle for people who just want the ability to exist in peace without being killed or denied literal life-saving healthcare. As I know that gays/lesbians, atheists, Jewish people, etc have all experienced, this country has a *huge* problem tolerating anyone that isn’t basically a WASP. It’s shitty to act like the term “woke” addresses anything other than what we’ve always struggled with: minding our own damned business and letting people be different when they aren’t harming anyone else. \n\nWhere does all this fuckery come from 9.9 times out of 10?

Between Bush, Obama, and Trump, and Biden, we now have a reputation of flip flopping at the whim of every election.\n\n\\*\\*This is why I'm the opinion that the US Senate should pick the secretary of state, separate from the presidency so that foreign policy can stay consistent and apolitical from domestic issues.\\*\\* The candidates can be chosen from a short list of recommended candidates, made up of nominees recommended by senators, various department heads, and the president. It can be done via simple approval vote, so that anyone who abstains won't be counted, and the vote can move forward quickly without obstruction.\n\nWith geopolitics requiring decades of consistency, a president shouldn't have unilateral power based on 4-year long domestic atmospheres. The Secretary of State could be 2 year biannually elections by the senate, with the ability of the Senate/president to call for a snap election anytime. It would establish a bipartisan foreign position that can outlast presidential administrations. Both parties would understand \\*that they might not retain a 51 majority\\* in the upcoming midterms, which therefore justifies keeping SoS candidates widely liked across the aisle to outlast each Congressional session as well.\n\nThis to me is the best way to handle foreign policy, since most Americans aren't equipped in understanding the complex impacts to geopolitics in the modern world. The average American doesn't really care about foreign policy and doesn't consider it when voting for president. Despite the president having the \\*most\\* sway over the topic, presidents are chosen based for their domestic stance which has caused unpredictability for the US on the international stage. When most Americans don't consider world events within their range of concerns, it's better to let experienced experts to pick a candidate within a pool of experts to direct how foreign policy is addressed for long-term stratagem.",

They suppress the story (it won’t be on the front page) or they simply will delay their reporting on it. \n\nOr 2.

Not just making jokes or talking shit on reddit. Things include but are not limited to:\n\n1. Vote and be politically active. Political activism isn't just the vote but the whole process. Every bit helps be it going to your local town hall, helping any campaign, or contacting your local representatives.\n\n2. Defy in every legal way possible: Put more in your 401K/IRA/Roth so as to reduce your taxes to the Fed. Donate (tax deductible) to anti-MAGA organization, pro-democracy orgs,  or donate to your local community. Realize capital losses against capital gains or earned income ($3K max per year against non-cap gains). Reinvest in your business rather than take profits. Work overseas. Etcetc\n\n3. Reduce spending with [hard red or MAGA states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states). You can just pay tariffs and buy from friendly countries even if they will not be buying our stuff. Yes Canadian whisky rather than Kentucky Burbon. Take trips to moderate or blue states if not overseas to friendly countries rather than going to deep red ones. A great way to spend locally if you're in a blue or moderate state. If you must spend in hard red states then do so in blue districts. Also I'm not saying to do 0 business with the rest of the country since that's impossible, but you can always go to Texas or Nevada rather than Kentucky or OKC. You can buy other products made Texas but avoid Telsa. \n\n4. Don't spend with GOP/MAGA donor companies for example Coke or Tesla. You can choose different brands or alternative. Certainly you don't have to pay for their brand premium and save with generic. Alternatively you can rely more on yourself, consume less, and/or work with businesses in your local community.\n\n5. Buy/spend what you need and cut unnecessary spending/consumption. Fed is paying 4% and stocks are falling. Do more DIY repairs/building (Trump wanted more Made in USA right?) rather than buying, spend more time with your family rather than on tiktok, spend less time on facebook but more with friends, do non-profit work for your local community rather than buying useless crap you don't need, invest in your health by working out or taking a strolling the park rather than drinking Budweiser beer, etcetcetc.",

On top of all this, if you put up more barriers to getting a visa, tourists will pick one of thousands of other destinations. I mean if you are planning a vacation and you are wealthy enough to afford one in the US then would you really put up with all the hassle that DHS is going to put you through?",

Those original schedules would have been modified by the SAVE act in March 2024, but that was mostly frozen by court cases and injunctions. This article has the appeals court agreeing with the district court in enjoining the loan forgiveness. Per the ruling: \n\n>The statute’s text and structure require ICR plans to be designed for a borrower to pay his or her loan balance in full through payments that can fluctuate based on income during the payment term. The power Congress gave the Secretary in 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1) to create repayment plans means **the Secretary must design ICR plans leading to actual repayment of the loans.**\n\n>...The Secretary has gone well beyond this authority by designing a plan where loans are largely forgiven rather than repaid. We thus affirm\nthe entry of the preliminary injunction...\n\nYou can like or dislike this-- but its not an action taken by the Trump administration, it has gone before two different courts who have found that it is likely that the states will succeed here, and that the SAVE act should not go into effect until a final ruling is made.\n\n--- \n\nEdit: just because this seems to be a point of contention: IDR Recertification deadlines are extended to Feb 2026, and SAVE loans are in forbearance until September. \n\nSources: \n\n- [Ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/higher-education/manage-your-loans/save-plan)\n- [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/student-loan-repayment-plans.html)\n- [TheCollegeInvestor](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/54707/idr-recertifications-to-be-extended-during-processing-pause/).",

The surge from $500 to $5,000 is not just a statistic; it hits hard when you consider other rising costs like housing and healthcare. \n\nWhat’s even more concerning is the psychological impact—financial panic isn’t just a meme on TikTok but a real phenomenon. Many are feeling trapped, weighing the options between deferring payments and the looming interest. It might spark a broader conversation on financial literacy, too. Understanding how compounding interest and payment plans work could really help folks navigate this mess. \n\nMaybe it’s time for a reevaluation of how we manage student debt—policies that foster more sustainable pathways to repayment could ease a lot of stress. That's where the economic discussion becomes critical. We need solutions that consider the long-term effects of these debt cycles, especially for a generation already facing so many challenges.",

But I *do* care that we don't create aristocracies transcending time and creating generations of useless \"socialites\" and nepo-babies who impose their will on us with endless money in politics. I think such a thing is toxic for democratic societies and overall economic mobility.\n\nFor estates exceeding a certain threshold (say $100M or more), I'd like to see hard caps of $5M per inheritor. Anything not disbursed would be taxed at 100% to the government. \n\nAdditionally, to bypass the possibility of loopholes (e.g. giving $5M to multiple \"charitable\" entities whose only employees are family), I'd like for additional taxes to be levied on individual inheritances if they cross a certain percentage of the estate being disbursed. \n\nSo if 30% of the estate was disbursed to inheritors, perhaps there's an additional 30% tax on those disbursements. If it's 80%, maybe it's as high as 80%. The exact proportions can be finessed to what makes most sense. I've always thought this was what we needed more than anything else but I'm also not an economist.
