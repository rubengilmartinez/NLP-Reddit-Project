This brazen extermination of a minority is just the beginning, the sloppy answer by the Ambassador in this interview a clear sign of their confidence that the world will not retaliate. \n\nMaybe, just maybe, this interview by the BBC is a sign of the UK government readiness to do something about the problem.

That’s why this letter is getting such a reaction here. If Trump (or a fictitious alt-president) had sent that type of letter, Erdogan would already be equipped to respond accordingly. That’s what he’s used to. That’s how politics usually work. Such an unconventional style of communication is not what Erdogan or other leaders are used to. It’s more difficult for them to respond to, considering the disproportionate amount of power the US has. Does Erdogan stoop to his level and respond similarly and risk sounding like a fool in front of the rest of the world? Does he answer formally and risk coming off as condescending and potentially piss off the US further? Either way, it’s likely more difficult for him to respond to.\n\nThink of this like Trump’s equivalent of LBJ insisting on going skinny dipping with foreign leaders so he could try to intimidate them with his anatomy. The goal is to put the other party in an unfamiliar situation to shake their focus.",

Everyone interested in security bureaucracies should read Gates' memoir, *Duty.* Despite being a Republican appointee, he was allowed to stay on as SECDEF for President Obama. In his book, he very openly talks about the serious trust gap between top Democrats, especially former VPOTUS Biden, and the U.S. military. In his mind, the Obama Administration had a serious distance with the DOD, highlighted in the article I linked by having non-elected civilians dictating commands and suggestions to military leaders, including forward deployed O-10s (four star flag officers.) Now, in a shocking turn of events after the very military-friend ties formulated by Reagan's massive military strengthening, a Republican president is showing distrust of the U.S. military.",

By dismissing these two actors doesn't Trump ultimately remove the the two main institutions that resolve 'national security' issues? For example, the Director of National Security informs on the security of the state, while the Chairman of JCOS acts on the decisions of the national security of the USA. Seems very strange to remove these two positions from national security, unless there is some ulterior motive to the decision making process here, i.e. Trump wants more control over decisions from select committees,etc.\n",

Lemme help.\n\nFrom http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/is-donald-trump-a-pawn-in-steve-bannons-game :\n\n> It’s just one piece of Bannon’s ideological game of chess, rewiring the media landscape to clear the path for a radical reimagining of conservative politics in line with his own nationalist agenda. The president himself, Bannon has admitted in the past, is just one piece of the puzzle. Trump is a “**blunt instrument** for us,” Bannon told Ken Stern for Vanity Fair last summer. “I don’t know whether he really gets it or not.”\n\nAnd this https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bannon-flattered-and-coaxed-trump-on-policies-key-to-the-alt-right/2016/11/15/53c66362-ab69-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html is very very interesting:\n\n> The clearest public sense of how the two will work together — and what policies Bannon may try to push — can be gleaned from a series of one-on-one interviews on Bannon’s radio show between November 2015 and June of this year.\n\n> In those exchanges, a dynamic emerged, with Bannon often coaxing Trump to agree to his viewpoint, whether on climate change, foreign policy or the need to take on Republican leaders in Congress.\n\n> At times, Bannon seemed to coach Trump to soften the harder edges of his message, to make it more palatable to a broader audience, while in other cases he pushed Trump to take tougher positions. He flattered Trump, praising his negotiating skills and the size of his campaign crowds.",

Honestly, not much information is available with regard to the aforementioned initiative.\n\nWith regard to Japan, their policy makers have always looked for increased investments in India, although this doesn't mean that they are foregoing their relationship with China. From what I've read, there is a very high probability that the RCEP will be signed this year, sans India (during the ASEAN summit on November). Asia Pacific Nations policy makers have recently been pushing for more inter-regional and global trade as a means to spur their economies and get past the doldrums caused by the pandemic. The agreement will basically solidify ASEAN as the major cog in the global supply chain.",

It halts a race to the bottom, so that all nations benefit on basis of merit, rather than on corporate tax competitiveness. Which countries are the ones which are (arguably) most competitive on the strength of their economies? The US and EU. The concept of being global rulesetters is increasingly being used by the US and EU to exert influence. \n\n* The big losers are, well, tax havens, the most prominent example probably being Britain. It is no secret that the EU is leveraging its economy against Britain, which aims to undercut EU financial services through deregulation. This could be a continuaution (and legitimization) of what is effectively the EU waging a trade war against the UK post-brexit.\n\n* Such a global tax rate would also be a win domestically for biden, as it would actually be a good example of \"foreign policy for the middle class\". \n\n* Germany and France backing this move could be a means for them to strengthen US-EU relations, and to rebuild the transatlantic alliance as between two equals, rather than as the US being the senior partner. Such a shift can have potentially massive ramifications; For the US, such an agreement lends them a more capable ally with which it is less entangled and has better relations. For the EU, it would no longer play second fiddle to the US.\n\nedit: As some of you have pointed out, this is also a push by Germany/France to leverage this deal against tax havens within the EU.",

One being revenue generator for the state, two being a tool for reducing inequality and third being a tool for implementing state's policy.\n\nNow what a Global Minimum Tax does is handcuff a country's ability to impact it's policy towards MNC's through tax. For example India is planning for Chip manufacturing and wants to attract foreign companies from US, Taiwan, SK and is willing to offer huge tax incentives for it.As it considers the infrastructural development that chip manufacturing brings more important than the tax loss, ie the tax loss becomes a cost of the infrastructure.A global minimum tax rate goes directy against that and stops the LDC and developing countries from using tax policy in a way they need.\n\nTL: DR Considering the revenue generating aspect of tax fails to look at the complete picture and a Global minimum tax will disproportionately affect LDC.",

My big preference – and I don’t say this through strength or weakness – is we work it out with Iran. But if we don’t work it out, bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran.”\n\n\nDuring his first term, Mr Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, which had imposed strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. \n\n\nHe also reimposed severe sanctions on Iran, severely impacting its economy. Despite this, Iran has surpassed the agreed limits of its nuclear program, particularly in uranium enrichment.\n\n\nAccording to a confidential United Nations report, the increase in Iran’s holdings of uranium enriched to 60 per cent, or nearly weapons grade, gives it enough to produce six nuclear weapons, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe report said that Iran is now producing enough fissile material in a month for one nuclear weapon, while Tehran maintains its nuclear programme is peaceful.\n\n\nTehran has rebuffed Mr Trump’s warning to make a deal or face military consequences. On Sunday, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said that the Islamic Republic rejected the option of direct talks with the United States, offering Tehran’s first response to Mr Trump’s letter via mediators in Oman.\n\n\nIt comes as the US continues its bombing of the Iran-backed Houthi militia’s facilities in Yemen amid the maritime blockade in the Red Sea region, in which the terror groups have targeted commercial shipping with attacks on US vessels.\n\n\nMr Trump has told Iran that any Houthi attacks will be treated as direct Iranian attacks, promising tough consequences.\n\nThere has been no official comment from White House or the State Department following Mr Trump’s comments.\n\n\nMr Trump is pushing for multiple deals that could reshape global security. The Washington Post on Saturday published parts of a secret document outlining priorities. The document says that the US would leave Europe to defend itself if invaded by Russia. It added that America’s sole priority is stopping China from taking over Taiwan.\n\n\n“China is the Department’s sole pacing threat, and denial of a Chinese fait accompli seizure of Taiwan – while simultaneously defending the U.S. homeland is the Department’s sole pacing scenario,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote in the memo.\n\n\nReferring to the document, the Washinton Post said: “Its force planning construct – a concept of how the Pentagon will build and resource the armed services to take on perceived threats – will consider conflict only with Beijing when planning contingencies for a major power war, it says, leaving the threat from Moscow largely attended by European allies.”",

          "text": "Submission Statement: U.S. officials have raised concerns over Europe’s growing push to procure weapons locally, a shift that may limit the involvement of U.S. defense manufacturers. This development comes as the European Union strives to reduce its reliance on non-EU suppliers, focusing on building its own defense industry. A key factor in this change is the European Union’s desire for greater autonomy in defense and the geopolitical pressure of increasing security needs. However, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, argue that such a shift could harm transatlantic defense cooperation and limit the benefits of NATO’s unity. U.S. defense contractors have long been suppliers of advanced military technologies, and American-made weapons are integrated into many European defense systems.\n\nThe European push aligns with efforts to strengthen the European Defense Fund, which aims to support the development of Europe’s defense capabilities. The EU has proposed increasing its investments in local weapons production as part of its broader security strategy. However, U.S. policymakers fear that limiting competition could undermine the quality of military technology available to Europe. Furthermore, they argue that buying weapons from the U.S. ensures that European allies benefit from cutting-edge technology and well-established partnerships.\n\nThere is also concern that this move may negatively impact the defense industry in both Europe and the U.S., potentially leading to trade disputes. The U.S. sees itself as an indispensable partner in European defense, particularly as Russia’s actions in Ukraine have heightened security concerns. The U.S. has provided critical support to NATO, and reducing its role could weaken the alliance. In response, U.S. officials are advocating for continued open defense markets between the U.S. and Europe to ensure both sides benefit from mutual defense and security advancements. Despite European aspirations for self-sufficiency, U.S. objections suggest that closer collaboration, rather than isolation, is essential for maintaining security in a rapidly evolving global landscape.",

Grandfathered Technology Rights\n\nInsist on extending these waivers or exemptions to past projects incorporating American parts.\n\nSeek written US commitments that any older tech—now crucial to European defense—can be freely used or upgraded under Europe’s direction.\n\nThis would include the right to modify F35 software (which Israel was granted).\n\n4. Mutual Defense Guarantees\n\nPair the technology deal with reciprocal defense commitments, so both the US and Europe see a clear benefit.\n\nEmphasize that a stable, well-armed Europe ultimately contributes to shared strategic interests rather than undercutting them.\n\nBy requesting these tailored provisions, Europe might avoid a broad ban on US companies yet still maintain operational freedom in critical defense scenarios.",

This shows how severe China’s infiltration is in Taiwan,” said Chung Chih-tung, an assistant research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, a government-funded think tank.\n\nThe cases fit into a broader pattern of intimidation by Beijing as it tries to undermine Taiwan’s defenses both militarily and psychologically and push the island democracy to surrender to Chinese Communist Party rule. The effort includes huge military exercises around the island.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, soldiers Lai Chong-yu and Chen Wen-hao were recruited by Chinese intelligence agents through a man named Huang Tsung-yi, a Taiwanese citizen accused of acting on Beijing’s behalf to persuade soldiers to sell information to China.\n\nHuang fled to China before he could be arrested, according to Taiwanese officials.",

          "text": "\nSS: President donald trump repeatedly claims that the European Union was “formed in order to screw the United States”. Canada, America’s northern neighbour and second-largest trading partner, is “one of the nastiest countries”. Russia was “doing what anyone would do” when it bombed Ukraine’s energy infrastructure during a pause in American intelligence sharing. Our polling with YouGov shows how this rhetoric is reshaping people’s opinions about their countries’ allies.\n\nUnsurprisingly, in America it is Republican opinions that have changed most dramatically since Mr Trump returned to office (see chart 1). Before the election our YouGov polling showed that just 12% of Republican voters thought that Canada was “unfriendly” or an “enemy”. In the most recent survey, which took place between March 22nd and 25th, that share more than doubled to 27% (these negative feelings were increasing before the election, too). Similarly, last year 17% of Republicans viewed the EU as “unfriendly” or as an “enemy”; that has now grown to 29%.\n\nPerceptions of Russia are moving in the opposite direction. After its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 Americans were united in condemnation: around 85% of registered voters thought that Russia was “unfriendly” to or an “enemy” of America. That share remained steady until the presidential election in 2024. Then views split along party lines. Now 72% of Republican voters think Russia is a foe. Over the same period the share of Republicans who think Ukraine is hostile rose by ten percentage points (see chart 2).\n\nMore surprising is that even Democrats appear to be slowly softening towards Russia and becoming more suspicious of America’s long-standing allies. It is difficult to know yet whether these small changes are enduring shifts in opinion.",

And if you watched domestic news like CBC, Canadians would often mock, belittle and attack American society and culture and the people (not simply the politics).\n\nWhat’s happening now is that due to the Internet, that hatred from our allies is now very easy to spot. Even my not-political sister was asking why so much Tik Tok content from Australians, Canadians and Europeans was just anti-American stuff. Hatred of Trump is legitimate but hatred of everything American really does cross a line for many people, even Democrats.\n\nI don’t know how much is organic and how much is bots, but the last decade has seen so much anti-American bile that even I have stopped subbing to many places. r/Europe was even cheering 1 million American COVID-19 deaths under Biden. That’s not just the Trump effect. That’s a far deeper level of hatred than is warranted.\n\nThe end result is that is seeping into the American perception of them now. How low is goes is hard to say, but this is really a case where the US numbers towards allies were just incredibly rosy-eyed and there’s a lot more room to fall.\n\nEdit: To the person below who blocked me so I couldn’t respond: It’s moreso that the criticism is selective. Belgium chopped the hands of Congolese slaves for fun 100 years ago. France committed horrific war crimes in Algeria in the 1960s. Britain killed hundreds of thousajds to maintain its empire even after World War II ended. \n\nHow many in Reddit know it was Danish policy until the 1970s to force birth control on Greenlandic women (ethnic cleaning under international law).\n\nSo the US’s dirty laundry gets aired but all of the Europeans pretend their farts smell pleasant. It’s hypocrisy.",

Hatred of Trump is legitimate but hatred of everything American really does cross a line for many people, even Democrats.\n\nThis is interesting, as an Australian the only real negative reaction I'd have to Americans *on the whole* is the hyper nationalism. Big tun off, cool it bros you're not special. There's probably a general amount of tall poppy syndrome going on as well.\n\nAs for Anti-American stuff besides that, could this just not be a reaction to the social media we're getting *from* the US in the first place? You're living in a dystopian-communist-fascist failed state according to Americans on social media (and your current president who effectively ran on this message in his campaign last year), why would we have a positive view of that? :D\n\n[EDIT]Do you have a link to the thread in r/Europe where they were cheering on the 1 million US deaths? Only thing I've found so far is your comment referencing it a year ago lol: https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ar9lxb/trump_reiterates_to_nato_allies_if_you_dont_pay/kqkboa4/\n\nOr a few weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/1j8ub90/europe_cant_trust_the_us_anymore/mhgss05/\n\nI've searched google for this: 'covid site:reddit.com/r/europe' during May 1st to May 30th 2022 and can't even see a thread for the news.",

When the US ban occurred, a few things happened.  In my experience, the US is very sensitive to any criticism and doesn't really get sarcastic humour.  Maybe because a lot of the rest of the English speaking world had a longer relationship with the British we seem to have a similar sarcastic sense of humour.  Sarcastic jokes were made about the situation.\n\nIn addition to the common theme of joking, the content that people were seeing suddenly changed, and a lot of people really enjoyed the difference.  It was like leaving the city and hearing all the birds for the first time in a long time.  Beyond the content, the tone of the comments suddenly changed as well, becoming a lot less blunt and confrontational.  \n\nThis change was noticed by many people, and it was honestly enjoyable to see such diverse content from around the world and a more pleasant tone in the conversations.\n\nWhen the ban was lifted, it was like a large number of vocal people from the US came back in with a chip on their shoulders.  They took maximum displeasure with any jokes about how the US wasn't present and went completely toxic everywhere in the comments and some in their videos.  I know this won't be the case for the majority of Americans, but the contrast is night and day.\n\nTikTok feeds videos based on its algorithm.

It's been easy for other commentators the past few weeks to see him as a realist trying to revive SOE when that's an inaccurate way to view it. Or they see him as a mad men when that's also not accurate since Trump lacks clear goals and credibility. American foreign policy has been relatively successful since the end of WW2 because it's always been backed by credibility (NATO) and strategic ambiguity (Taiwan) when necessary.  What's happening now is worse than the faux realism seen during the second bush admin in that Trump is damaging alliances and global security for no discernable benefit apart from grievance while causing former allies to seek stronger ties with China and India who are more reliable even through they are less ideologically aligned.\n\nEdit: I'm also clarifying that in his essay, End of History, he's making that case that human ideological evolution flattens out at liberal democracy. He's saying that nothing humans conceive of will bring greater prosperity and cooperation among nations than that. He's contrasting that to other ideologies that claim liberal democracy is a stepping stone to something greater and more utopian.",

Tony Blair is an example of what a liberal Neo Conservative would look like, which is much closer to Fukuyama than Bush Jr. and much more based in moralism, Blair is as well interesting if you compare his justification to many arguments for action today)\n\nNeo Conservatism as a counter movement to realism is based upon putting morals at the center and you can in hindsight see it clearly in the arguments it made always putting Saddam Husseins evil nature at the core of their propaganda.\n\nedit to link this to article, imho we have multiple camps in Trumps administration, from \"real realists\" like Elbridge Colby, to basically neo Cons like Rubio, to the third most influencial camp imho which are post neo Cons (or anti neo cons) like Vance an Hegseth, who are highly disillusioned GWOT veterans (you find this weird strand of resentment often in Veterans) who are out for payback against the neo cons that in their mind lied to them during the GWOT and want to purge this ideology from the military, intelligence agencies and state department, they imho do not qualify as realists as they have not broken with ideology or some of the principles of Neo Conservatism.",

However, the more combative nature of the vice-president's views on foreign relations shows that there is a potential for these relations to become more strained over time.\n\n>Vance was contending that once again the United States is doing what Europe should be. It is consistent with his past arguments that the US is overpaying for European security and the derision he displayed toward European allies (almost certainly the UK and France) when he described them as “some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years”. (Both fought in Afghanistan and the UK fought alongside the US in Iraq).\n>\n>...\n>\n>Then Vance went a step further. He tacitly admitted a difference between his foreign policy and Trump’s saying that the strike would undermine the president’s Europe policy – one that has been led by Vance in his divisive speech at the Munich Security Conference where he accused European leaders of running from their own electorates and of his Eurosceptic comments on Fox News.\n>\n>“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” Vance wrote. “There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n>\n>...\n>\n>At heart, the disagreement indicated that Vance’s views of foreign policy are not quite aligned with Trump. Trump broadly sees the world as transactional and optimists in Europe have claimed he could force a positive outcome by forcing those nations to spend more on defense budgets. But Vance appears far more confrontational and principled in his antipathy toward the transatlantic alliance, and has attacked European leaders for backing values that he says are not aligned with the US.\n>\n>That makes Vance even more of a concern for Europe. Kaja Kallas, the European foreign policy chief, accused Vance of “trying to pick a fight” with European allies. Another European diplomat said: “He is very dangerous for Europe … maybe the most [dangerous] in the administration.” Another said he was “obsessed” with driving a wedge between Europe and the US.\n\nThis seems to show that the current American plans to weaken or destroy existing alliances proceeds apace, and that there might be additional unpredictability from this administration on the foreign policy front.",

Hear me out on this.\n\nSo I don't support Trump, and for what it's worth, I was in military intelligence for a couple of decades (I got out a few years ago, and this is 100% opinion). I couldn't fathom a group of people I used to work with doing this and no one saying anything. A lot of things need to fail. Like even the 20-year-old kids wouldn't be this bad. This information flows through particular networks, not commercial ones (obviously, we realize this and point to Trump's incompetence and hypocrisy--case closed).\n\nBut what if Trump leaked this intentionally?\n\nThis signal group chat seems beyond dumb. What the reporter saw potentially was scripted--it all happened, but it was planned in advance. This leak was probably a \"reality TV\" stunt to further some other deliberate aim. I think Trump often baits the people who oppose him, and he knows \\*we want to believe\\* stuff like this.\n\nAnyway, I reviewed the group chat logs, and they have two distinct parts.\n\nPart 1 was a lot of presumably classified operational data. Still, it was two hours beforehand and wouldn't have done the Houthis much good (also, it is common practice, even recently, that foes warn their enemies in order to prevent escalation; if Israel warned Iran a few months ago, then I think we probably warned the Houthis in this instance).\n\nSoviet and Russian propaganda often have a 60/40 rule, which could be 60% truth and 40% manipulative data. So, I think this second part is worth exploring.\n\nIn the 2nd part, they're making a case (and sending a message to Europe) that the US isn't going to secure the Red Sea anymore and will expect Europe to do that moving forward. This policy contrasts with how it has been since the Suez crisis in the 1950s. So it's like they're telling Italy, Spain, France, etc, that they can expect to take care of Yemen in the future. A \\*major\\* policy shift.\n\nThis leak may have been a reality TV skit to get this into either the public zeitgeist (now Trump can talk about this in the coming days?) or messaging to specific European leaders and shape broad geopolitical policy.\n\nImportantly, the narrative the Trump officials presented on securing the Red Sea/Yemen strikes is debatable at best (example: I'd argue that Yemen is directly related to Iran and, therefore, Israel and the US have a security interest there as a result). Still, many people will read about this for the first time and form perceptions based on these alleged 'war room' chats.",

My prospects are better.”\n\nZelensky did not say why he believed that Putin, 72, was approaching death. There have been rumours for years that Putin is suffering from Parkinson’s disease or cancer. None has been confirmed, however.\n\nThe average life expectancy for a Russian man born in 1952 is only 67 years. However, Putin has access to top-quality healthcare beyond the means of most of his citizens. He is also believed to be nearly teetotal.\n\nZelensky also said that Putin, who has been in power for 24 years, was afraid of losing control over his people and that Ukraine’s western allies could help to destabilise Russia by keeping up sanctions and other measures to weaken its war machine. “If they push Putin, he will face destabilisation in his society and he will fear it,” he said\n\nIt is not clear whether Putin’s eventual death will cause profound changes within Russia, or whether his allies will simply continue on his path. “After Putin, there will be Putin,” Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of the Russian parliament, said in 2020. “Everything that happens after President Putin will happen according to the patterns he laid down.”\n\nRussian scientists were reported to have been ordered last year to come up with anti-ageing remedies by an official working for Putin, who is said to be obsessed with the idea of eternal life. Putin is also reported by local media to take regular baths in an extract of blood from the severed antlers of Siberian red deer, believed to have powerful rejuvenating powers.",

Neither will Ukraine stop to fight once he’s dead, nor with Russia stop the invasion once Putin is dead unless there’s a genuine revolution.\n\nProbably Zelensky is emotionally compromised after the attacks at his home village were made after Russia used Americas “dealmaking” prowess as a hole in the wall. I’d be mad as well but either way, the status quo won’t end when one is dead (even though Putin deserves it)",

For as unpopular as the US's moves are right now, its a pretty bipartisan shift. Those on the left will do nothing but sit idly by as the right reasserts its imperialist edge. The left has no better solution and while the tariffs are stupid on their face, everyone is in agreement that the budget is not sustainable. The EU is not anywhere near united enough to consolidate and provide a continental military. It is a fragile union, made for economics, not war. It very well may fracture when the going gets *really* tough for its members. Some rely on Russia for energy, others are not as ideologically opposed as the rest of the EU might like.\n\nAll bets are off.

If the US were to join, it could potentially reshape the diplomatic relationship between the US and Canada, and would likely involve changes to the way the countries exchange diplomatic representatives. The Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 nations, most of which are former British colonies, could potentially become an even more important global organization if the US were to join, even as an associate member.",

I think we'd be better off developing relations with EU and exploring the whole CANZUK idea.\n\nIn principle, though, the Commonwealth is supposed to be a club of former British colonies that we freely gave independence to.

          "text": "Arms companies from the US, UK and Turkey will be excluded from a new €150bn EU defence funding push unless their home countries sign defence and security pacts with Brussels.\n\nThe planned fund for capitals to spend on weapons would only be open to EU defence companies and those from third countries that have signed defence agreements with the bloc, officials said on Wednesday.\n\nIt would also exclude any advanced weapons systems upon which a third country had “design authority” — restrictions on its construction or use of particular components — or control over its eventual use, the officials added.\n\nEU member states would not be able to spend the money on products “where there can be a control on the use or the destination of that weapon . . . It would be a real problem if equipment acquired by countries cannot be used because a third country would object,” one of the officials said.\n\nThe UK has lobbied hard to be included in the initiative, particularly given its key role in a European “coalition of the willing” aimed at bolstering the continent’s defence capabilities. UK defence companies, including BAE Systems and Babcock International, are deeply integrated into the defence industry of EU countries such as Italy and Sweden.\n\nIf third countries such as the US, UK and Turkey wanted to participate in the initiative, they would need to sign a defence and security partnership with the EU, officials said.\n\nTalks between London and Brussels on such a pact have begun but have become embroiled in demands for a larger EU-UK agreement that would also include controversial issues such as fishing rights and migration.\n\nThe exclusion of the UK and Turkey will create major headaches for big European defence companies with close ties to producers or suppliers in those markets.\n\nThe move will cause significant consternation in Britain’s defence sector. One senior UK defence industry insider said it was a “considerable concern”, adding: “We see a huge amount of opportunity and it’s right the UK is seen as part of Europe. But if the EU — and especially France — is going to be transactional about this, it undermines the entire philosophy of a joint and unified Europe in defence and security terms.”\n\nPrevious French efforts to ringfence defence spending for EU companies only have met with stiff resistance from countries such as Germany, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands that have close ties with non-EU defence producers.\n\nUnder the terms of the plan, EU countries would be able to spend the loans on products using components from Norway, South Korea, Japan, Albania, Moldova, North Macedonia and Ukraine, officials said.",

Defence structures, too.\n\nAnd furthermore, this is about investing into the defence industry. Economics and defence are intertwined topics. And considering the EU is also an economic union, the answer is yes: Brexit was also about defence issues.\n\nThe UK does not have a right to EU investment. It's EU money, paid by the EU taxpayer. It's completely reasonable to want to exclude third-parties from this fund as much as possible to increase self reliance.\n\n‘We have been committed to defending Ukraine as early as 2015’\n\nWhich is a good thing, yes.\n\n‘meanwhile you have major EU economies (Spain, Italy) sitting on their arses.’\n\nI agree, this is bad.\n\nNone of these are actually arguments for why EU funds (meant to revive and build up the EU defence industry) should go to the UK, though...\n\n‘Yes Brexit was a colossal fuckup but how on Earth are we less trustworthy on defence than them?!’\n\nThey stayed in the Union, the UK didn't. It's EU money. It makes sense that EU money is first and foremost spend on EU defence industries.\n\nBut who knows what will happen. Maybe if the UK proposes to contribute a giant sum themselves into this fund as well, they can work something out of it.\n\nBut I will return to my original point. The UK does not have a right to EU defence investments. If the EU wants to spend that their money in the EU, you do not get to demand a piece of that pie.\n\n\n=From me :\nJust sign the defense agreement then.",
