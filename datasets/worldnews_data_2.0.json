          "text": "Okay for everyone wondering what impeachment is vs a removal of office.\n\nImpeachment is like charging you with a crime. So the House of Representatives charged Trump with abuse of power & obstruction of congress.\n\nRemoval of office comes about when the House of Representatives vote by a majority to impeach on each charge (known as an Article of Impeachment), that goes to the Senate, and then by a 2/3 majority (67 Senators) in the Senate to vote to convict, and only then is the President is finally removed from office.\n\nIn other words, impeachment is like being charged by the DA for manslaughter, removal of office is when the jury decides you're guilty of manslaughter. The DA is the House, and the jury is the Senate in this analogy.\n\nEDIT: Instead of giving me gold (just DM me your potatoes), please take the time to check that you're registered to [vote](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/) and consider donating to the ACLU or [Fair Fight 2020](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vsafairfight), an organization ran by Stacey Abrams (GA 2018 Gov nominee) that protects the right to vote. Fair Fight 2020 specifically focuses on fighting against voter purges.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI keep getting asked whether or not a President that has been impeached and removed from office can hold office again. He cannot if the Senate votes as to do as such specifically (source 3)\n\nSource 1\n\nThe Constitution of the United States, Article 1, [Section 2](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-2--2), Paragraph 5\n\n> The House of Representatives shall have the sole Power of Impeachment\n\nSource 2\n\nThe Constitution of the United States, Article 1, [Section 3](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3--2), Paragraph 6\n\n> The Senate shall have sole Power to try all Impeachments.

Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg\n\nJuly 19, 2018\n\nJames B. Comey, James R. Clapper Jr. and John O. Brennan at a Senate hearing on Russia’s election interference in January 2017.CreditAl Drago/The New York Times\n\nBy David E. Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg\n\nWASHINGTON — Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.\n\nThe evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.\n\nMr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.\n\nThe shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.\n\nOn Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin’s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.\n\nOn Wednesday, when a reporter asked, “Is Russia still targeting the U.S.?” Mr. Trump shot back, “No” — directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)\n\nHours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, “because he’s in charge of the country.”\n\nIn the run-up to this week’s ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.\n\nThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the “Steele dossier.” That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump’s activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.\n\nAccording to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin’s role in the election interference.\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, the day he was briefed on cyberattacks designed to sway the 2016 American election.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times\n\nThey included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U. had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.\n\nAnd ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin’s own role.\n\nThat included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.\n\nInstead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.\n\nThe same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called “hand-to-hand combat” to dig in.\n\nThe pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.\n\nAfter the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said “Russia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries” were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations — including the D.N.C.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump said in his statement, “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.”\n\nMr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.\n\n“I was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,” he said in testimony in May 2017. “And they were very aggressive.”\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.\n\nMr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clinton’s loss in the election.\n\nMr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russia’s election interference.\n\nOnly Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.)\n\nPresident Trump, meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, said he accepted Mr. Putin’s denial of Russian election intrusions.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAnd the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling.\n\nIn March, the Department of Homeland Security declared that Russia was targeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security.\n\nJust last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were “blinking red” and called Russia the “most aggressive foreign actor, no question.”\n\n“And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy,” he said.\n\nChristopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, also stood firm.\n\n“The intelligence community’s assessment has not changed,” Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. “My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.”\n\nThe Russian efforts are “aimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,” he continued. “We haven’t yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level.”\n\n“It’s a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.”\n\nAlmost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russia’s election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics.\n\nHe dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a “witch hunt” against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russia’s role — and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trump’s immediate orbit may have worked with them.\n\nIn July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow’s cyberskills were so good that the government’s hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.\n\nSince then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure — as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday — he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings.\n\nThat is what happened again this week, twice.\n\nMr. Trump’s statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack.\n\nThat contributed to Mr. Trump’s decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered — although he also veered off script to declare: “Could be other people also. A lot of people out there.”\n\n",

The approach the US took these past several weeks in publicly and frequently airing accurate intelligence has put Putin in a tough spot. There's no getting around the fact that he's been lying this whole time (to the world and to his own people), and that the US was telling the truth. \n\nThere's a universe where Putin could have NOT invaded Ukraine and actually made Biden look like an alarmist fool. But he didn't do that, and now he's the one who is coming across as irrational. No idea if this will lead to Putin's overthrow (wishful thinking) but hopefully it dulls his sheen within Russia and helps more Russians understand that he's not trustworthy.",

          "text": "\nMy take on NATO’s strategy here. Putin’s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin’s logical madness. \n\nNATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. \n\nWhen toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. \n\nThe issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. \n\nAs Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to “contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. \n\nWith Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin’s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. \n\nThe west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn’t know, and isn’t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.\n\ndit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I’m just calling it like I see it.\n\nEdit2: yes I posted this many times. I like hearing people’s response to my views.",

Emanuel Macron.     \nFrance [bureaucracy](https://www.ege.fr/infoguerre/les-pertes-de-souverainete-industrielle-cas-decole-la-francaise) sill has [PTSD](https://www.vie-publique.fr/rapport/38473-proteger-nos-entreprises-des-lois-et-mesures-portee-extraterritoriale) from the affaire.   \n\n\nIn other words, Trump is strongly hinting that he is willing to weaponize the DOE, under the guise of his anti-DEI ideology (to please his crowd), for America's (or rather his owns) interests.     \nSeeing what Obama was already capable of, waiving the flag of anti-corruption (in the case of Alstom, not without some objective arguments), it's sobering to imagine what the Trump team can concoct and feel justified doing.   \n\nObviously in Trump USA one can demonstrate subservience, buy favors and avoid scrutiny in many different ways.   \nIt'd be interesting to keep tabs on donations to GOP candidates from American subsidiaires of foreign companies.",

Another sits squarely in the path of where Putin’s ambitions have been inching. And the third? Right on Russia’s northern border, perfectly positioned for any hypothetical push toward St. Petersburg. If a wider conflict were to erupt, that territory would be crucial to secure immediately.\n\nIn fact, when you look at a map, you’ve got Finland, Lithuania, and Estonia, surrounding the Russian end of the Baltics, Denmark at its entrance. The inner perfectly placed for a drive toward St. Petersburg, and deeper into Russia beyond that. Is this about reclaiming “NATO lake”? Securing St Petersburg? Something else entirely?\n\nTrump’s exactly the type to say “fuck it” and ignore the bird flu entirely if it meant driving prices down at home. Optics have always mattered more to him than outcomes. I just don’t buy the idea that he’d willingly go begging to Europe, it makes him, and by extension the US, look weak. He let hundreds of thousands die through sheer negligence during COVID. What’s a few more deaths if it means saving face? That’s pocket change to him.\n\nI play a lot of chess, and this doesn’t feel like desperate scrambling for help. It feels like a closed position, quietly shifting pieces, waiting for the right moment to crack open the centre. Trump might be a clown, but the people behind him (except the South African immigrant welfare queen) aren’t inept, aren't restraining him this time around.\n\nI don’t know what’s coming, but there’s more to this than meets the eye.
