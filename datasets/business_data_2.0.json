CEO Anne Wojcicki remains optimistic about taking the company private, despite significant financial struggles, a drop in market value, and ongoing legal challenges. The company is at a critical crossroads as it searches for new leadership to guide its next steps.",

Allegedly it goes online in June, though I'd be surprised if it weren't being fast-tracked.\n\nDo not be fooled for one second that Donald Trump himself is to blame for this. It wouldn't matter anyway, but don't let these weasels scrape this off on him, because this plan has been rolling for at least two years and probably a lot longer than that. Trump gets the blame because they've been chopping him to pieces for months for having the audacity to win the election they risked so much to rig.

          "text": "I’m not familiar with this case, but in general, these types of headlines are a gross oversimplification of the facts. \n\nCompanies do not know about dangerous side-effects and hide them, they constantly receive reports of all sorts of side-effects and they have to over time, determine which ones are caused by the medicine versus the myriad of other factors that can also cause these issues and they have to then balance the risk of the side-effects against the benefits the medicine provides. It is extremely complex,it takes a long time to get enough data to draw out correlations and there is also harm caused by removing a product from the market because people need the medicine for its intended use. They then also need to balance the damage caused even if it is found to be causative against the benefit provides in keeping on the market. You also need to take into account the type of medicine. Would you accept your hair falling out and vomiting blood for a headache tablet? No, but you would if it was treatment to stop you dying from cancer. \n\nThe lay person looks at the gap between the first side-effect reported and the date when they decide there is a correlation that is serious enough to take the product off the market (or change the indication) as years - and grab their pitchforks claiming “big Pharma” is hiding side-effects. \n\n40 years as obviously an extreme example and as I said I’m not familiar with this case, but it is not unusual for this to take at least some time. It’s also worth noting that it’s less to do with the number of years and more to do with the frequency of events over time.",

Congress calls pharma reps, hospital reps, patients who have been financially ruined by the cost of the drugs, are in debt, and can no longer afford the drugs that were keeping them alive.\n\nEveryone hates big pharma. Obamacare is passed.\n\n2020, Covid is here, and we're all in a tizzy about when big pharma will provide the vaccine to save us all from the virus that was supposed to kill tens of millions of Americans.\n\n2021, the vaccine is delivered. And here's when things got funny.\n\nIt you believed in the vaccine, then you started to look upon big pharma like your savior, like they were the good guys, and politically aligned with you. If you didn't believe in the vaccine, or you thought big pharma was hiding test results (they were), or bad reactions (they were) or deaths (they were), then you didn't trust big pharma, and were sure they were not politically aligned with you.\n\nIf you trust big pharma, Pfizer in particular, I ask you to think back to 2008, 2009. Didn't you outright hate them at that time? Do you feel that because of Covid, you are obligated to trust them, despite their history? Do you defend them?",

Unlike Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr Pepper, Pepsico has a massive food business — its sprawling portfolio includes Quaker, Frito-Lay and more. And when it comes to beverages, Stanford noted, it seems to be focused on its zero sugar lines rather than classic Pepsi. \n\nSeveral thoughts: Please don’t stop with the diet/zero versions of Mt. Dew; they’re better than the regular. Figure out your energy drink game, Pepsi! You bought a failing brand in Celsius and then…kept doing the same thing with it? And I guess abandoning Rockstar? Monster is CONSTANTLY coming up with new flavors and zero sugar versions, but there’s like, four Rockstar’s I ever see (regular, zero sugar, fruit punch and zero fruit punch). And then they tried cans with nitrogen in it to make it creamier. Delicious! But not worth $3 per. And now they’re gone. ",

And as the struggling company closes stores, it will invest cash in cryptocurrencies.\n\n>GameStop revealed in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it expects to close a “significant number” of additional locations in the coming months, although the “specific set of stores has not been identified for closure.”\n\n>A majority of the closures occurred in its biggest market, the United States, with 590 locations shutting down and reducing its store count to 2,325 as of February 1. More than 330 locations closed across Europe, plus nearly 50 stores in Canada and Australia.\n\n>Globally, 3,203 GameStops remain — down drastically from its peak of about 6,000 a decade ago.\n\n>GameStop has closed hundreds of stores over the past several years because it has struggled to adapt to customers’ changing habits of buying games online and streaming. The company was also center of the “meme stock” craze in 2021, which briefly boosted its stock.\n\n>GameStop joins a number of other well-known retailers closing stores or completely disappearing, including Joann, Forever 21, Kohl’s and Macy’s. Among the reasons contributing to the retail exodus is continuing inflationary pressure on consumers’ wallets, pressure from private equity and retailers not quickly adapting to changing shopping habits.\n\n>As part of GameStop’s pivot away from retail, the company also said that it’s getting into bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, announcing that a “portion of our cash or future debt and equity issuances” might be invested in the digital currency.\n\n>“The pivot to bitcoin is really a defense against irrelevance,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail told CNN, adding that it’s “an odd thing as it’s basically saying the strategy isn’t retail but to act as some kind of cryptocurrency investment vehicle.”",

Logistic capacity will not greatly reduce.(edit: not clearly explained, when I say  logistics, I’m not talking about number of boats or trucks. I’m talking about the switch from container ships to bulk freighters for raw material imports, if the US goes America first it means to go from importing steel products into importing iron and coal to make steel for steel products, across the vast number of industries, there will be a gigantic shift in freighting demand, which will outpace the ability for our domestic ports to move material back and forth towards factories)\n\n3. American manufacturers won’t oversupply themselves into bankruptcy.\n\nThe steel makers are letting go of 600 people today, but in the broader picture, they could be making the wrong decision and should be cutting their workforce even more.",

Horrible diseases wrecked havoc in cities and very little could be done other than sending patients to their room through quarantines.\n\n9.

Like a combined millions of vehciles ever year across different brands. This is nothing new or substantial. It's just getting blown up by main stream media oulets.. The ones that are consistently getting called out for lying to us all the time.\n\n It's a recall not a factory buy back like the headlines portray by saying \"recalled thousands of Teslas\". Recalls mean you go to the dealer and they fix it for free under warranty and then you drive it back home. I'm sure any of you that have owed/own a new GM, Chrysler, Ford, Subaru,..  the list goes on but if you own a new vehicle you'll get recalls. If you own an older model year, you'll get less recalls.\n\nWhen you buy a new vehicle nearly half of the price tag is to cover the new car warranty so the factory can keep up with reimbursing dealers for warranty repairs on vehicles sold as well as the anticipation of the various forms of recalls/campaigns prompted by dealer feedback, customer feedback, and NHSTA investigations.\n\nGM had a recall for literally putting EMPTY heated seat modules in their new trucks.. like a plastic shells instead of a computer module.  They all do dumb shit all the time. \n\nQuality has fallen to the way side in today's automotive industry especially in domestic brands. Factorys want retuning customers not reliable builds, thats why they promote \"brand loyalty\" purchase incentives. Is what it is. This is a result of us buyers always wanting something newer and better. \n\nI know this for a fact because I manage a warranty claims department for the largest dealership conglomerate in my state who sells and services multiple brands. \n\nThe resolve? Buy something built before 2010 and keep it running or buy new and trade in every 3 years or 36k miles or lease... unless your upside down on your loan for driving the piss out of it.\n\nPs. Most everything built after 2019 seems to be junk unless it's top tier brands.. at best.\n\nA vehicle is the worst return investment you can make. Just try and do it smart to loose the least amount while getting what you feel is most valued to your wants, needs, and financial situation. All brands have pros and cons and no one vehicle or \"deal\" is best for everyone \n\nRant over, some of the most legit advice you'll hear in this topic, your welcome.\n\nGood luck, have fun, buy smart.",

          "text": "“Tesla investors are having another rocky day, with shares down as much as 7%.\n\nThe stock is headed for an ninth-straight weekly loss, and now sits 53% below the all-time highs reached in mid-December.\n\nAs each day passes, the list of headwinds facing the EV maker seems to grow. In addition to existing pressures, Tesla on Tuesday faced fresh competition from China and an analyst price-target cut.\n\nBelow are four forces — two new, two evergreen — driving the acceleration in Tesla’s share-price decline.\n\n1. BYD’s new battery tech\n\nThe Chinese firm BYD unveiled an EV-charging station that it claims can deliver up to 400 kilometers driving range after just five minutes of charging. This would be a big step up from current charging technology, with Tesla’s quickest version providing a 275-kilometer range after 15 minutes of charging.\n\nThe development creates another headwind for Tesla as it tries to break into Chinese market.\n\nBYD plans to build 4,000 of these chargers across China.\n\n2. Wall Street scaling back forecasts\n\nThough RBC maintains an “outperform” rating on Tesla, it cut its price target to $320 from $440.\n\nThe analyst Tom Narayan expects lower pricing on Tesla’s full self-driving technology as autonomous offerings become increasingly standard across the EV industry. Meanwhile, given heightened competition in Europe and China, Narayan lowered robotaxi-penetration assumptions.\n\n“As a result, we now lower our market share assumption to 10% from 20% in both markets,” he wrote.\n\nRBC’s adjusted forecast adds to a growing string of downgrades plaguing Tesla. Last week, JPMorgan lowered its price target by about 41% to $135 per share, citing lower guidance on vehicle deliveries.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\n3. Slowing vehicle sales worldwide\n\nSales data this year has bolstered market gloom, with consumers sidestepping Tesla in favor of other EV competitors.\n\nChina shipments of Tesla vehicles fell 49% year-over-year in February. The company sold 30,688 Chinese-made vehicles, its lowest number since August 2022.\n\nA similar trend is showing up in Europe. January Tesla purchases in the region fell 45% from a year ago, compared to a 37% jump in overall European EV sales. The pattern continued into February, with sales in Germany falling by 76%.\n\n4. A distracted CEO\n\nIrritation is also growing with Tesla’s leadership, as investors question the priorities of CEO Elon Musk.\n\nMusk — whose firebrand image as a tech innovator helped propel the stock to past records — seems increasingly distant from the company, minting cynics out of Tesla’s old-time bulls.\n\nIn large part, investors have blamed his growing role in the Trump administration, with Musk heading the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency. He himself has noted “great difficulty” in dividing his attention between DOGE and his many companies, a statement investors were likely unhappy to hear.\n\n“We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin, and it’s become clear he’s now spending more time on DOGE than anything else,” Garrett Nelson, CFRA’s senior equity analyst, previously told BI.”",

          "text": "Is LCBO that big of a purchaser of Kentucky Bourbon? \n\nI mean, with the US population being so much larger than Canada I figured, yes it would have an impact but not this big of an impact. \n\nEdit, [just wanted to add this comment on another thread from a Kentucky Redditor which is relevant](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j44sjw/people_of_kentucky_how_do_you_feel_about_the/)\n\n> A lot of the responses are really just here to dunk of Kentuckians so I just want to provide an actual response.\n> \n> The biggest concern I have as a Kentuckian isn't just that people are not going to buy $9.3 billion in goods from our state, it's that the resulting consequences will be seen for generations. Something a lot of people may not realize is that most of the distilleries in our state are in small towns. They are almost the entire local economy for some of these areas (and for a few of them, the entire county). Once these distilleries start laying off people it's not like there is somewhere else for them to go work. These families likely will not have the money or resources to find work elsewhere and with little interest in real estate in those areas they will be tied down by their own assets. Many of those towns already have issues with cyclical poverty but this will just make the problem largely unsolvable.\n> \n> To be clear, I understand that Kentucky is a bit of a laughing stock for many people and as a liberal living here I can attest that many of the perceptions people have are justified. Personally, I am in complete agreement with the boycott. We can only hope that there is a way for our country to course correct but I can't say I am hopeful of that.\n\n> Edit: This kinda blew up and while I would like to reply to everyone I only have so much time on my lunch break. I am actually a grocery data analyst and this issue is quite complex. I can write for hours about the downstream effects of this boycott (from the distribution companies, warehouse workers, even the brokers who manager these accounts externally). I just wanted to address a few of the major questions people have been asking:\n\n> 1) I think the split for people blaming Trump for this is about 20-80. I think most Kentuckians will blame Canadians for boycotting their products without seeing the nuances of any of this. It is terrible and I really wish they could understand why Canadians (or other Americans) would stop buying our products but if there is anything we have learned from this past decade it is that we live in a post-truth era where no amount of facts will satisfy their anger.\n\n> 2) I worked on Alison Lundergan Grimes's campaign as well as Amy McGrath's and unfortunately both lost to a man who has do irreparable damage to America (McConnell). Something to consider is many Republicans also hate Mitch, it's just that they see him as giving Kentucky footing on a national level. \"Having him as Senate Majority Leader means he can do more good for Kentucky\" is a very common sentiment among R's who would vote him out otherwise. It's upsetting, I hate it, but I do believe it is possible to replace his seat with a Dem going forward.\n\n> 3) I cannot be more clear that I believe the boycott is a good thing. I know it will hurt people in Kentucky and I feel like that is probably for the best. My concern isn't that the people who voted for Trump this time around will suffer. It's that their kids, their grandkids, their great-grandkids and so on will suffer as the towns die out, crime rates skyrocket, and isolationism festers.\n\n> Hope this answers some questions people have and I am happy to respond to any messages later today!",

The American spinach sat full while the Canadian BC blend of lettuce was almost sold out. I’ve never seen so many people reading labels of country origin as I have the past few weeks. This is not about the tariffs. This is about the disrespect of our sovereignty. The damage is done and I fear the consequences will last a very long time.

Insurance companies will eventually catch on that they are paying disproportionately higher claims for Teslas than other cars and they will jack up the insurance rates to cover themselves so even if you don't get vandalized you will be paying more insurance. And, Tesla doesn't have a monopoly anymore.
