          "text": "I‚Äôm currently on an indefinite round-the-world bicycle tour, and spent two months this summer bikepacking Mongolia & wanted to share some thoughts and photos.\n\nMongolia is definitely not a place you want to come to unprepared, especially if you want to venture further inland rather than just following the handful of asphalt roads. Only 20% of roads in the country are paved!\n\nSo get yourself some wide tires and know how to repair your bike - it‚Äôs unlikely to come across a bikestore in the countryside of the least densely populated country in the world üòâ\n\nI spent majority of my time in the Altai Mountains in the far west of the country, where most locals are actually ethnically Kazakh. Since Mongolia was never part of the Soviet Union, the Kazakhs here actually managed to preserve their culture better than those in modern-day Kazakhstan.\n\nEncounters were always nice, you will be offered plenty of Airag (fermented horse milk) and rock-hard cheese. But the food isn‚Äôt the reason you come to Mongolia, it‚Äôs to experience the way of life of the nomads and to enjoy the nature and remoteness.\n\nThose things can be quite challenging at times, not only does it require one to carry food for multiple days, drink water from streams and rivers (bring a good filter!) but it also requires a sturdy tent. I had multiple nights where I had to reinforce my tent wall with my body so it doesn‚Äôt collapse, because of super strong winds. I also experienced a snowstorm in June while crossing one of the 3000m passes.\n\nOne minor mishap I had was when I got a deep cut in my foot because I slipped during a river crossing - luckily I was close to a village but it‚Äôs better to have a sufficient first aid kit in case you are in the middle of nowhere. There is also little to no cellphone service outside of the settlements, so an SOS beacon could be a wise investment.\n\nIn the villages you will find a pharmacy and a couple mini-markets, but don‚Äôt always expect restaurants or homestays. These small grocery stores are surprisingly well stocked, in my experience it‚Äôs easier to find what you need here than in big cities in China!\n\nAfter over a month in the Altai Mountains I made it to the next ‚Äúbig‚Äù city to witness the Naadam, Mongolia‚Äôs biggest annual festival. Celebrating their culture with traditional outfits and dances, as well as the ‚ÄúThree Games of Men‚Äù: Horse racing, wrestling and archery (where women also compete). It was a show that I won‚Äôt forget, and you shouldn‚Äôt miss if you visit Mongolia during summer.\n\nAfter skipping a few hundred kilometres of the asphalt road through the Gobi desert by bus I cycled another loop in the Khanghai mountains in the centre of the country, where the nature was similarly beautiful and slightly less rugged. It was a bit greener which meant more nomads, and a lot more livestock - yak, sheep, goats and a couple horses.\n\nI then continued my way towards Ulaanbaatar, the capital, where I got my Chinese visa for the next adventure- the Tibetan Plateau (where I am now).\n\nEdit: Thanks for the overwhelming support, unfortunately I can‚Äôt respond to everyone. I will post some pics from other countries I‚Äôve cycled across in the coming days. ü´°",

What, in your personality, or those who do similar things attracts you to do something like this.  I'm reminded of \"Into the Wild\" about Chris McCandless giving up what seems like a traditional successful lifestyle to just go out and live whereever (within the US).  He's frequently criticized for being an idiot and dying due to lack of knowledge of living in nature.  Unfortunately, it obscures the idea that he gave up a traditional 9-5 job that would likely have paid well, a decision very few people in his position make.\n\nAnd how long do you think you'll do this.  Since you started around the pandemic, that would be about 4 years.  Do you expect to live this way indefinitely?  What do your parents think?",

          "text": "What seems like a lifetime ago, I lived down in Central TX (Killeen for the ones who would know üôÑ) and had a similar situation. I had just moved in, and was at the mailboxes (the development was broken up into quadrants and each one had its own area with a big ‚Äúbank‚Äù of mailboxes) and got to chatting with one of the neighbors. She informs me that her family is having a cookout, and that I should swing by. \n\nNormally I‚Äôm an incredibly reserved person and would never lol but I had moved from Maryland to Texas to live with my best friend at the time while he was in the Army who then went back home for a visit a week after discharge and just kinda never returned, so I just moved out (since technically I was never actually on the lease üòÇ). Due to this and my reluctance to return home with my tail tucked, and also I was getting the vibe that she was into me so I said fuck it and decided to go. \n\nI waited about an hour after the time she told me that it started and headed out the door and started walking. I then realized that I never got the address (I was incredibly shy and had low self esteem back then, I was not great at communicating effectively with women especially if they showed even an ounce of interest lmao), just the general street that I saw her walk back down so I just started walking in that direction. About halfway down that street I heard the loudest party sounds I‚Äôd ever heard and figured that was the place so I walked into the backyard and started scanning around for the woman that had invited me.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I realized that not only do I not see her, but I‚Äôm the only white person in this yard. Literally everyone else is very obviously of some sort of Spanish-speaking lineage. I start asking for Maria in what little Spanish I remember from high school and I‚Äôm met with about 100 confused looks when they hear my awful Spanish, followed by them pointing at one of about 25 different women at that party named Maria. At one point a man with a comically large cowboy hat and belt buckle shoved a 24oz Modelo in my hand when asked where Maria was, so once again I said fuck it I‚Äôm already here so I sat down to enjoy my beer and just take it all in. \n\nA few moments later, an elderly woman sits down with me and in English as broken as my Spanish asks who I am, who I‚Äôm looking for, etc. so I tell her my story. She starts laughing hysterically and calls over at least a dozen other Abuelitas and tells them my story, to which they all respond similarly. She comes back after they all chat a bit, and tells me that the family I‚Äôm looking for lives on the next street over. Apparently I saw her walk down this street bc she was on her way to this literal house to wish a happy 15th birthday to the girl that lived here.\n\nNow I‚Äôm the first to admit that I was extremely naive to  a lot of traditions of other cultures (still am, but I‚Äôve been actively trying to learn and expand what I know of cultures other than my own) but I knew how big of a deal that was and I was immediately mortified. I just barged into some girls fucking QUINCE√ëERA, and I‚Äôm just sitting there like I belong with a beer in my hand and I‚Äôm sure the most curious mix of utter embarrassment and shame on my face. \n\nThe Abuelitas all assured me it was fine I was there and insisted that I eat some of the food and have more beer and tequila. The food was some of the best I‚Äôve ever had, and to this day I‚Äôve never seen that brand of tequila on a store shelf here in the states but it converted me into a tequila fan for life. I ended up having a great time, made some great friends in the area for the rest of the time I was living there, and the father actually walked with me over to the party I was originally supposed to attend and introduced me as the gringo that crashed his daughters Quince√±era to many appalled faces until he very rapidly in Spanish explained what happened. I do have to say, I admire how quickly and efficiently they seem to be able to say everything that needs to be said üòÇ. Stayed at the second party til the sun came up the next day and made even more friends.\n\nGotta love stories about locals taking hapless tourists/visitors/new residents under their wings.",

Less expensive than the Bernina, less pushy tourists trying to claw past you for a photo out the window, more stops (what‚Äôs the rush?). Downsides are that it‚Äôs less cozy than First Class Bernina, and the Bernina makes tourist stops at Alp Gr√ºm to let passengers get epic photos from that spot.\n\n2. If you want to take the Bernina, DO NOT get First Class seats! First Class are huge panoramic windows, but they are not openable and throw glare and tint on any photo taken though them. Found this out the hard way, and it was beyond frustrating. Not sure if this post is from Second Class, but the commuter train DEFINITELY has drop windows. We ended up taking the commuter back from Tirano to St. Moritz, and the feeling of the wind in your face and being able to peer out the windows is an unbelievable experience.\n\n\nBlanket note that the train journey itself is outstanding, and the scenery is just as good as the OP video... goes from forest, to high mountains, to overlooking huge valleys, to hugging aquamarine lake coast, to entering an old old Italian city.",

It was only a moment ago (for sleep knows no time) that the\nflat horizon was a loamy gray swell merging into the fog behind the\nicy glass. But now rocky, powerful mountains are massing out of the\nground (where have they come from?), a vast, strange, overwhelming\nsight. This is her first glimpse of the unimaginable majesty of the\nAlps, and she sways with surprise. Just now a first ray of sun through\nthe pass to the east is shattering into a million reflections on the\nice field covering the highest peak. The white purity of this\nunfiltered light is so dazzling and sharp that she has to close her\neyes for a moment, but now she‚Äôs wide awake. One push and the window\nbangs down, to bring this marvel closer, and fresh air‚Äîice-cold,\nglass-sharp, and with a bracing dash of snow‚Äîstreams through her lips,\nparted in astonishment, and into her lungs, the deepest, purest breath\nof her life. She spreads her arms to take in this first reckless gulp,\nand immediately, her chest expanding, feels a luxurious warmth rise\nthrough her veins‚Äîmarvelous, marvelous. Inflamed with cold, she takes\nin the scene to the left and the right; her eyes (thawed out now)\nfollow each of the granite slopes up to the icy epaulet at the top,\ndiscovering, with growing excitement, new magnificence everywhere‚Äîhere\na white waterfall tumbling headlong into a valley, there neat little\nstone houses tucked into crevices like birds' nests, farther off an\neagle circling proudly over the very highest heights, and above it all\na wonderfully pure, sumptuous blue whose lush, exhilarating power she\nwould never have thought possible. Again and again she returns to\nthese Alps sprung overnight from her sleep, an incredible sight to\nsomeone leaving her narrow world for the first time. These immense\ngranite mountains must have been here for thousands of years; they'll\nprobably still be here millions and millions of years from now, every\none of them immovably where it‚Äôs always been, and if not for the\naccident of this journey, she herself would have died, rotted away,\nand turned to dust with no inkling of their glory. She‚Äôs been living\nas though all this didn‚Äôt exist, never saw it, hardly cared to; like a\nfool she dozed off in this tiny little room, hardly longer than her\narm, hardly wide enough for her feet, just a night away, a day away\nfrom this infinitude, these manifold immensities! Indifferent and\nwithout desires before, now she‚Äôs beginning to realize what she‚Äôs been\nmissing. This contact with the overpowering is her first encounter\nwith travel‚Äôs disconcerting ability to strip the hard shell of habit\nfrom the heart, leaving only the bare, fertile kernel.‚Äù\n\nFrom The Post-Office Girl by Stefan Zweig",

Sounds fancy right? That is their courthouse and was where all civil ceremonies were performed. It just added another dimension to our travel because we got to see parts of Florence no normal tourist sees like the inside of the U.S. consulate, the Sala Rossa in the the Palazzo Vecchio, and some of the office buildings like the notaries office. The Vice Mayor of Florence performed the ceremony in Italian and an interpreter translated to English. Our wedding certificate which was filed with the U.S. consulate was written all in Italian and we joke that for all we know, we bought a  laundromat since we signed things we weren't able to read ourselves. The best decision that we ever made and I wouldn't change a thing.",

It's hands down the most amazing experience of my life and I couldn't recommend enough. \n\nEDIT 2: If you guys want to read more about our journey my buddy summed up each day in his blog. His writing style is damn hilarious and fun http://www.wanderlunge.com/blog/ (the Run part starts about a quarter down the page.. you'll see the same pic where it begins)",

I started playing and my wife and kids were sitting outside.  I was playing and playing and playing... and I kept telling the guy that I was done.  I didn't want to play anymore.  It was raining outside now and my family walked over to a nearby shop.  He just kept telling me \"Very good game\" over and over.  I finally convinced him that I wanted to quit.  He seemed very perturbed.  \n\nHe took all the balls you see behind [me](https://i.imgur.com/6wj4blc.jpg) and poured them into a counting machine (there were a lot more when I finally quit).  Then he took me over to a counter and gave me a little goody bag of a little milk drink and granola bar.  Then he slid across a couple brightly colored shiny gold bars in little plastic cases.  He told me to redeem these at a shop around the corner.  By this time it was pissing rain and I gave the goody bag to my kids and told them I would be right back.  I went to the shop an it was a shady little corner with only a window.  Kind of like a bank teller.  I handed him my little gold chips.  Then he ruffled through bills in a machine.  I had won some $250.  \n\nMy wife and kids still make fun of me... \"Oh, no, I want to stop winning, hahaha\"  I had no idea what I was doing and just wanted to get out of there.\n\nTL:DR - played pachinko, didn't know what I was doing, wanted to leave, had no idea I was winning a bunch of money.",

Most of the staff are very easy to chat to thought and I didnt feel targeted or singled out.\n\nGermany is 100 times worse. We were only passing through and we're there a very short time but still it was the worst part of my trip. All the staff are incredibly rude and intrusive. No hello how are you or good morning. Just very blunt and borderline offensive questions. Even the woman at the little convenience store in the airportopened the conversation with a very serious look on her face and demanding to know where Im from. I dreaded every time I had to interact with one of them because I knew it would be super uncomfortable. I noticed that the males in the family got a lot less of that.",

One time I was questioned about my trip and things having nothing to do with travel; at one point they questioned why I didn't have luggage, I explained I had a carry-on (I one bag) which was gate checked and missed the flight.  They didn't believe me and I had to wait while they called my earlier airlines to confirm this, nearly missing my connection. I was there for over an hour watching other passengers come and go. The second time, I remember being passed to a different higher level person and thinking their questionnaire was asking pretty invasive question, beyond what was allowed.  No idea why this happened either time.\n\nThat said,  I did go two years with all but one flight being randomly selected for additional screening (none to/through/from Canada). When I finally demanded an explanation on I was 'randomly' selected on every flight, TSA said it was because I was a white middle-aged male and not a protected class.   I haven't been selected since then.",

Maybe even Tomorr national park which is nearby Berat.\n\nAnd in general, public transportation can still be hard to navigate for most foreigners on their own. I would suggest you look into pre-planned itineraries with travel agencies since they will take care of transportation and bookings etc. If you would like to go on your own, I would definitely suggest you rent a car.

I love seeing people from everywhere in the world, all in different situations; some going back home, some on the way to a vacation, a business trip, and some on the way to a new life in an unknown country. I always bring things to keep busy in airports, but I rarely use them. I will end up walking around, eating weird meals at weird hours, and watching people, wondering what their story is. Weird? Maybe. But I think it's interesting.",

I live extremely frugally. I opened up a separate \"travel\" savings account and I skim as much as I can from each paycheck and put something in there every time I'm paid. Sometimes it's nothing but sometimes I can throw a few hundred in there. I never touch it EVER. It adds up and allows me to show my kid a little piece of the world now and again without going Into debt. We just got back from Morocco which was awesome. Is there anything you can give up on? Netflix, Uber eats, Friday night beer?  Really go through your expenses. If you can save even a few hundred bucks a month on anything, do that and open a savings account and put that money in there, you will be on a plane soon! It sucked being a poor haha I feel you, but if you make it a real priority you may be able to make it happen. I'm routing for you!",

I also got a travel credit card right away, put all my expenses on it, pay it off every month, and accumulate points/rewards to put towards flights.\n\nTraveling is cheaper than people think, the key is to try and be flexible with either the dates or the location (ideally both). From there, you have to do a lot of research on the front end to maximize credit card points, hunt for deals, and plan your trip yourself so you‚Äôre not paying extra for tours or day trips you could DIY.",

If you have flexible dates then you can search for 2 weeks in April or 1 week in September kind of thing. Flying from Denver I've had $425 airfare to Costa Rica, Columbia and Peru using that strategy. Find a cheap room someone is renting out in their house on Airbnb, eat with the locals and you have a week long vacation for well under $1,000.\n\nOne challenge you'll have is that you'll need to drive to a major airport which might be a few hours because I doubt you'll find those deals from Omaha. Look at the off times when everyone else is working. The time between Thanksgiving and Christmas is nice. Late January is another good time. If you want warmer weather in Europe April and September are shoulder seasons and offer cheaper prices than summer or spring break. \n\nAs others have noted, reward credit cards are awesome. They're only great if you pay them off every month, otherwise you're earning 2% cash back but paying 17% interest and that math doesn't math. Wells Fargo and Citi both offer a 2% cash back card with no annual fee. It might take a few years but save up $1,000 worth and free trip. \n\nI'm not anywhere close to rich and I live a very frugal life. I don't eat out very often and I rarely will drink when I'm out because it ends up being $10 after tax and tip for a beer I can buy for $2 at the store. All those dollars add up and I can take vacation and get experiences instead. \n\nTraveling is my passion and it has improved so much in my life. Experiencing how others live and view the world will open your mind.",

I keep a travel slush fund and belong to a travel deal site, and can go anytime I can snag cheap deals. (I use Going--formerly Scott's Cheap Flights--and one \"deal\" more than pays for the yearly subscription.  (I think $45).  I'm going to the UK in a couple of weeks for $400 that I found on there. (also helps to live near a travel hub) I stay with a friend while there so it will be a cheap trip.  I live very, very frugally.  I don't have a fancy wardrobe and rarely buy new clothes.  I've never owned designer stuff (apart from a pair of Calvins in the 80s ha).  My house is a modest 70's house that's paid for. I rarely ever eat out or buy expensive coffee drinks.  When I travel, I stay in a place with free breakfast and then eat again around 4 or 5:00 so I only buy one meal a day. In really expensive places I get an Airbnb with a kitchen and cook my own meals.  I time excursions to catch off-peak prices or free days, etc. Oh, and the #1 money saver?  I never had kids.  I always wanted two, so I figure there's $500,000 to put towards travel. lol But as we know here in the US, we are all just one medical emergency away from the poor house so I work out several times a week and walk every day to try to stay healthy and in shape to be able to hike, climb, get to what I want to see. I also have combined medical care with travel to save money--dentists in Buenos Aires and Istanbul!   Bottom line: prioritize.  ps--I also side hustle pet watching on Rover.  I may substitute teach this next year.  Will hustle to travel.  LOL",

Literally, I've used Uber Eats *once* in my entire life, and it was at midnight in South Africa because I didn't feel safe walking alone to get food.

Now I still pick up freelancing jobs on top of my day job.  \n\nIt's not so much about travel as it is about deciding what to prioritize in your finances.

Being able to take my time, knowing that I have plenty of time to get where I need to be without having to worry about long check in or security lines, weirdness at screening points or any of the the thousand things that can slow you down at the airport is key to keeping my stress level down when I travel.  So I personally tend to arrive at the airport 60 or more minutes prior to departure, with the exact time depending on where and when I'm traveling.\n\nThe vast majority of the time, I make it airside and have plenty of time to get to my gate.  And that's why I like having lounge access, because it's more comfortable than sitting at the gate.  The WiFi's better. If something happens with my flight I've got easy and convenient access to an airline agent (because I'm in an airline lounge and not the Priority Pass Lounge) to help me sort things out. The restrooms are cleaner and usually less crowded. And yes, I can grab a snack or more importantly for those early morning flights a decent cup of coffee - for free. At most (but definitely not all) airport lounges it's also calmer and quieter than sitting at the gate. \n\nOh, and as an added bonus - when I fly Delta from ORD there's a possibility that I can board the flight DIRECTLY FROM THE LOUNGE! I admit, there's not too many places where that's a perk of lounge access, but when you can take advantage of it it's pretty awesome.\n\nNow that's if you're in the US where gate areas tend to have quite a bit of seating - things are very different at European airports where they don't really encourage passengers to arrive at their gates early.  Again, a lounge is a nice alternative to walking laps through duty free or trying to find a clean table or place to sit in a food court and central waiting area while you wait for the notification that it's time to head to the gate area for boarding.\n\nI don't buy lounge access, it comes with my primary credit card.",

For instance, I flew from Las Vegas to Amsterdam last week, and the flight was ‚Ç¨1200 if I booked KLM Las Vegas -> Amsterdam, but the same exact flight was ‚Ç¨560 if I booked KLM Las Vas -> Amsterdam -> Luxembourg. So adding an additional flight leg saved ‚Ç¨640. Why airlines do this, no idea, but if you are flying into a large hub airport as your final target destination (Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Salt Lake City, whatever), it is quite frequently cheaper to buy two one-way tickets with hidden city ticketing and just bail on the second leg of the flight. It's a mystery to me too.\n\n  \nYou can check this right now for fun. Look on Google Flights, look for one-way tickets from Las Vegas to Amsterdam, and look for KLM. The direct flight LAS->AMS next Monday (28th) is ‚Ç¨1526, but the direct flight LAS->AMS->LUX on the same day, the exact same first flight, is ‚Ç¨1230. So you save ‚Ç¨300 by adding an extra flight to the end.",

I was staring so intensely that he asked me what I was looking at. He then proceeded to offer me another unsolicited ride at the same price.",

Just did not care. When people asked for photos I obliged and then asked for theirs. I had some genuine interactions once I let my guard down and embraced my alien presence. For the most part, I was shown lots of love by the Indian people and the looks were understandable curiosity. \n\nOne thing that really did get to me was the way crowds can become aggressive and dangerous in an instant. Literally inside temples and people shoving with total disregard. It was insane. Stampedes with multiple casualties are a fairly common occurrence. Just recently at a pilgrimage site and about a month ago a deadly stampede at a train station in Delhi. \n\nIf I return it will be to a rural setting and far from crowds.,",

I cannot tell you how many people roped me into their family photos for some unknown reason.    I found India loud, colorful, crowded, rich, poor, frenetic and peaceful.  It is the sort of place that requires total immersion.  Anything less will not yield a love match.  I would caution against planning a hermetically sealed trip that focuses on western hotels, private tours, etc.  You will miss the best of India if you take that route.  I was extremely fortunate to arrange a couple of meetings with Indians before I left home.  One happened by chance through LinkedIn.  I answered a question to which an Indian man responded.  He ended up introducing me to several folks in Mumbai who became my local friends.  All of them were excited to share aspects of the culture with me.  Rashi took me shopping and threw a party for me.  Ronan took me for a food tour of Bandra that culminated in dinner at a Parsi restaurant.  Mohit took me shopping and on to a pre-wedding celebration held on a rooftop surrounded by swaying palms.  When I contracted pneumonia and developed a pneumothorax, Mohit took me to his doctor and came to see me everyday while I was in the hospital.  He is still a dear friend.  Sumit made sure I made it safely to the airport in my weakened state.  I met a group of women through a shared love of fiber arts.  Three of them took me shopping and showered me with small gifts over an afternoon of knitting together.  Another knitter asked me to come to her home for dinner, later revising the invitation to include having me as a house guest and showing me things I would never have seen about her region had I been the typical tourist.  The human connections I was blessed to make with Indians and the things they were generous enough to share with me were hands down the best parts of my trip.    Some not great things happened as well.  I expect that with any long trip but they were far and away eclipsed by the wonderful experiences I had seeing not only the typical sites, but the things Indians were proud to show me.    If you are open to it, you will find magic, beauty and grace in India.   Indians are incredibly generous if you just take the time to form real bonds with some of the locals.",

Your suggestions about private everything is spot on. The looks I got from people especially the men was truly unnerving and rattling. I was happy that I was with an Indian Tour Company and our guide told me what how to handle the situation. Also if it wasn't for people wanting to touch me, touch my hair (locs), and rub my skin to see if my melanin would come off. I mean there were native Indians DARKER than me but I was the attraction??!! The food was AMAZING and I will leave it at that and I put India on the same list as China when I visited The Great Wall of China. I give people grace in foreign countries as they may have never seen an actual Black person in well person (pun intended) but the touching and grabbing is just too much....Also Petra was AMAZING in Jordan and I will most definitely go back again when the opportunity arises.",

The busiest among my visits was an annual exhibition for floral arrangement.\n\nWith so much engagement and awareness of art at the civic level, I wonder maybe that's why many art forms, like anime and manga, originate from Japan?",
