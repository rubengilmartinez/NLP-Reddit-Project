That's very intentional but not overtly partisan. Second, the border between the red bricks and the White House isn't just jagged, it has disconnected red bricks in the White House side, using bricks as pixels and data bits, communicating the nature and methods of Russia's hacking and digital influence through swarms and torrents of data and propaganda.  \n\nI appreciate when designers put in multiple layers of meaning like this.  \n\nEdit: Also worth calling out (even if obvious), the hand-illustrated/screenprinted style of the art and the muted color tones match the style of Soviet-era propaganda posters.  \n\nExamples: http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-most-sensational-and-lurid-soviet-propaganda-poster-1464264698/",

God knows why, but after I read through the article it clarified that there’s no solitary “island” in the typical sense, but rather a large swirling soup like mass the size of  America out in the ocean. \nWhich to my chagrin turned out to be true.

Even though I don't work in design anymore, I love to save stuff like this when I find it. It's just so neat. :)\n\nI do have to agree with a lot of the other commenters here on the type, though. It could use some adjustments. Personally, I'd choose a lighter weight typeface (that might just be a preference, though). I'm also mildly annoyed by the way the \"in a\" is placed. It seems kind of wonky. It's hard for me to state exactly why, however. I think it's because 1) it's going above the letter height of the x right next to it and 2) it seems unbalanced, possibly because we have a longer word sitting on top of a smaller one. Looks like it's going to topple right over. Just a nitpick, though.\n\nSomeone mentioned doing \n\n    F O X\n\n    I N A\n\n    B O X\n\nThat actually might be a better solution. Also, it makes a box, too! :)",

It was as if all the effort went into the icon design and then the type was made to fit into a compact shape. I'm not really a fan of the Gotham/geometric typefaces here and think there could've been more exploration around something condensed or with a little more playful in the terminals. \n\nObviously everyone has there thoughts but for me this is not finished or successful. \n\n-J",

I think the darker blue definitely makes it feel more serious/professional, however the light blue doesn't quite work without the red - you lose the \"patriotic\" feel.

Logos should work in greyscale, as you pointed out.\n\nI agree with others that the curved arrow doesn't promote 'stability' and forward thinking. I tried a version where it's only curved outside of the H and is mostly straight inside, and I don't think it works. But I get where you're coming from that the current arrow is too static.\n\nSo what if you use a more serious blue, keep the red and that fat arrow, but give the arrow just a *little* bit more of a curve?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gfSQYDp\n\nand compared to her current logo:\nhttp://imgur.com/009iXcG\n\n\nEDIT: I did these before the 9/11 thing got pointed out. I totally agree, and now I'm laughing that I wrote \"Hillary Airlines\" underneath that one... Funny what a simple icon can make your brain do!\n\n**EDIT2: Alright guys, so the consensus is that mostly my take felt British. I think this is due to the navy color in combination with the white angled lines (and obviously the red.) I made the white gaps a little thinner and recolored. What do you think about this coloration - does it look more American?**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GT2HZGF.jpg",

This rectifies the loss of the original repetitious geometry. That said, it now lacks asymmetry. Try giving it some depth, to loosen the flatness. See below to explore your iteration further.

This means something different to everyone. Usually it means add like a .5db sweep from 600-800. Maybe start at 1db at 500, and dip to like .25db at 1khz. Remember, Phon curve. If not that, run it through a tube compressor, physical or VST, slam it, then take out that part of the chain when they leave.\n\n\"can it sound more modern/radio friendly/brighter?\", slam it to -0.1db in a multiband compressor with a shitload of compression between 10-13k.\n\n\"Make it pop\", make the cymbals sound like shit then dial it back when they leave.\n\n\"Give it some kick/oomph/power\", kick the girlfriends guitarist out of the control room because what they mean is \"my boyfriends guitar isn't loud enough\".\n\n\"Make it sound like this record\", give up and use the plugin presets because no one fucking cares about a good mix and the presets sound good enough for todays homogenized indie band. Also I am guy with 16 preamps in a 12U flight box. That record you like was recorded on a Neve 8038. That ain't gonna happen. I can make it sound fucking great, I can blow your mind with how good it will sound, but I am not a dude with one of the best studios, and most coveted recording consoles in the world. Go away. Lower your expectations anything you record is going to sound like shit because it's 2016, you still haven't figured out how to play in time because your drummer refuses to play to a click, and you want to be the next \"Nirvana\". There is one Nirvana and you're 30 years late! Be something else!\n\n\"Since I'm doing the mix can you use all the bits and record it at -0.1?\", that means be glad you're a sole proprietor who paid an entertainment lawyer a fuckload of money for an airtight contract, then tell them to fuck off and they still owe you half.\n\n\"Why can't we just overdub?\", because you Mr. Bassist can't play in time and the reason your part sounds so different in the mix than it did in the studio is because I spent two hours off the clock re-recording every 4/4 120 I-III-V-VI key of C part you played. There's four strings and I've only seen you use three of them, and the 80/20 rule applies to that third one. How do you fuck it up? I DON'T EVEN PLAY BASS GUITAR! I PLAY DOUBLE BASS! My stupid ass had to prop a bass guitar up on a table and hold it vertically so I could figure out how to play it.\n\n\"I make beats\", yeah whatever. Leave me alone 14 year olds don't have jobs and can't afford my rates.\n\nSometimes I miss it, sometimes I don't. Though usually I do.",

But honestly, I’ve felt a huge shift in how people see my work ever since they started using ChatGPT in their daily lives.\nNow they think what I do is super simple, and because of that, they ask for even more absurd stuff than before... on top of crazy deadlines. And when I raise concerns about some of these requests, I usually get responses like “just do it with ChatGPT” or “use Photoshop’s AI,” as if that alone could magically solve all the challenges my job involves.\nMy fellow professionals, who are also in stable positions, have felt the same thing: this overall devaluation of our profession. On top of that, our higher-ups are expecting us to take on tasks that aren’t even part of our role, like writing content and other responsibilities we were never assigned.\nIt’s super frustrating. I was already feeling pretty discouraged about my career because of how little it's valued professionally and financially, but now things feel even worse.\nPS: Sorry if my English is off!

So, yes, many many jobs will go away. But there must be an out; designs that require precision can’t be created so easily.

Instead of losing your job IE or another source of income.\n\nIsn’t a better mentality to learn AI and see how it can help your workflows ? \n\nAll I’m saying is the next smarter person will just say they know ai and have an advantage over you. \n\n\nAs a designer, never stop learning and improving your craft. If that is using AI to an extent in your work. Then you should get with the times because the fact is every company is using AI in their creative teams. Whether it’s to generate stock images or help generate certain elements in the artwork. It’s just a harsh reality.\n\nIv found that more opportunities have opened as a creative when stipulating how I use flux and stable diffusion and all these ai models. \n\nCurrently I am a senior Multimedia Designer at a large e-commerce site and we use AI to fast track a lot of our images we use. From upscaling, to adjusting poses of certain models and products. The grunt work is still being done by Photoshop but not having to scour shutterstock for hours is refreshing.\n\nSpeaking of which, every interview Iv been to lately has asked about my experience with AI as a designer. So take that as you will. \n\nEnough chit chat. Learn, progress and look at it as an opportunity rather than holding yourself back.\n\nPeace.",

There are many examples, but here’s a close one: when I finished university, I found myself in a strange position. I could design anything, but the available jobs were going to people who knew how to use Adobe Photoshop. So I learned Photoshop. Then the Internet came, and I realized web design was about to explode. So I learned to code.\n\nMy point is: change is inevitable. You’ve got to adapt or die. As simple as that.",

It's the real product, the right amount, and it's standing on its own. But it's not \\*exactly\\* how it'll look always, that's true.",

You have to come to terms with that. It's very difficult but it can be freeing too once you pass through the worst of it.\n\nAll those other skills they have you doing are actually valuable. I graduated with a design degree with a photo minor and worked in campus IT. In small companies like yours the more hats you wear the more valuable you are in terms of keeping you employed. When I was in the same boat you were I edited around 300 videos for YouTube. As sole web person, knowing SEO has helped me tremendously. It's not what you want to do be doing but it's worth learning. \n\nYou still have a job. They found stuff for you to do. In this current employment environment that counts for a lot. I stuck it out through a similar period because I needed a paycheck and health insurance.\n\nNow what to do:\n\nStart applying to other jobs, you said its niche but work on your portfolio and start seeing what other employment opportunities are out there.\n\nWait it out. This is what I did. I had a new boss who was one of the most colossally arrogant \"I know how to do everything, I opened Photoshop once so I'm a designer\" people I've ever met. I was moved from salary to hourly, reclassified as a production artist, and just given tons of video work to do. It sucked. That person also managed to alienate everyone else in management, had a freakout and quit. My new boss is one of the absolute best people I've ever worked for. I was made salary again and given a huge raise when she took over. You might be able to just wait it out. \n\nLet the VP own everything. It's their show now so just let them go. If customers complain or suppliers or whoever, just let them eat it since they're responsible. Don't bail them out, don't fix the work they get on fiverr, you're not a designer anymore! You've gotta help Carol in accounting get her printer drivers setup as part of your IT role.",

For me, once my spidey-senses picked up those vibes, it was usually 2-3 months before the call came to be laid off. If you quit, they don't have to pay you unemployment. It is a very tough market for anyone right now, especially coders and designers.\n\nI agree with others' advice on you calling yourself a Brand Manager, Product Designer, or similar. I would start by searching those jobs and take notes on the other suggestions being mentioned on those job sites. You also have enough experience for a manager, director, or VP role, so take a look at those resumes and apply to those too. I would schedule an interview with you right away.\n\nCover letters aren't worth much these days due to the high volume of applications received from recruiters and normies. So instead of spending your time on that part of the application, I would focus more on fine-tuning your resume a bit to match the job description. Don't be obvious or use AI. However, they will most definitely use an AI service for finding keywords, so remember to load your resume with those.\n\nWith your experience and devotion, companies will LOVE that even if you are disposable right now. In this market, you will have to keep your senses high and your resume fresh.\n\nGood luck and I hope this helps",

It's not just hobbyists.\n\nI'm also reminded that people used to say the same thing about CorelDraw! because Adobe stans hated the aesthetic and doofy built in clipart, and how people used that to make some really horrible designs for crap like junk mail and phone book ads.\n\nThe reality is that CorelDraw! did at least 10 to 100x the actual paid work because it was cheaper and more accessible than Illustrator.\n\nIt also had better bezier curve management at higher precision. Pre-CS Illustrator (and i think up until about CS 1 or 2) had a max document scale of about 24 feet and could barely handle millimeter precision at that scale without throwing bugs, and tended to crap out at around 250k-300k nodes.\n\nCorelDraw! could handle FIFTY MILE WIDE documents with five decimal points of precision at mm scales, and easily handled node counts into the several millions.\n\nThere's a reason why CorelDraw! was in every CAD driven sign shop, vinyl cutter, screen printer and even large format print bureaus.\n\nAs a super old school graphic designer that grew up doing optical/analog layouts with actual pen, paper and film \"For hobbyists\" doesn't carry any weight, here, and Adobe is a fucking awful company anyway.\n\nYou can do all of the same masking, editing and image processing in GIMP that you can do in PS. All of the real tools that matter are there.\n\nAnd, well, if you're relying on Photoshops more \"advanced\" features like AI cloning, warping or image generation because you can't do it the old school way? Or how to do a full magazine, catalog or book layout with thousands of assets without the integration of InDesign?\n\nMaybe you're the hobbyist, here. Maybe you went soft and forgot how to work.",

In fact, the intention with a move like this is quite the opposite. A brand wants to create a situation of trouble, if possible, to lead the consumer into buying their product.

The short film is actually made by disney like 12 years ago so it's not hard for them to use a combination of 2d and 3d to quickly push out animations. Maybe the kids just aren't into it as much. The technology is clearly there. squash and skew and all those animation techniques were added to the 3d wheelhouse decades ago. and no one is making fully 3d movies for backgrounds and such. The kids like cocomelon-like things though. I think the reputation of 3d movies is really bad though. Kids think they're scary probably because of all the things tom does to jerry family guy and so on. They no longer feel like cartoons are for kids",

Now, thinking of him, I can’t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is. I’m utterly disgusted. If you really want to make creepy stuff, you can go ahead and do it. I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.”\n\nThat resurfaced shortly after the AI Ghibli explosion. It’s after he was presented with a character that was a scary monster that used its head as a leg because it couldn’t feel pain. \n\nGhibli also sent a bunch of cease and desist letters to “creators”. I don’t believe he’s happy about the whole situation.",
