Ironically McKinley was shot during a public speech he was giving laying out a departure from his high tariffing policies, rejection of protectionism, and a new fondness for free trade. \n\nEven back then tariffs were strongly opposed and used on the campaign trail to great effect by democratic candidates back in 1890. McKinley lost his seat over it, it was a landslide year for the Democratic Party.",

Look at the wage stagnation in the USA since the 1970's. Look at the growth of wealth inequality in the USA since the 1970's. All of this is because corporations have continued to offshore manufacturing jobs to other countries for their cheap labor and zero regulations. It has hollowed out this country and more people live in debt and poverty now in the USA than ever before.\n\nEvery single person complains about this. Everyone complains that wages have not kept up with inflation, that they cannot afford to buy a home and live on a single person income anymore, everyone complains that the rich have too much and everyone else has too little. \n\nBut nobody wants to actually change that by reversing the policy of offshoring jobs and reducing the trade deficit? This is how stupid people are today... Classic reddit behavior here. Nobody is smart enough to even act in their own interest anymore.",

Global trade expanded.\n4. **1990s**: The creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and regional trade deals further liberalized trade, boosting global trade flows.\n5. **2000s–2010s**: While tariffs kept falling, protectionist sentiments grew, especially after the 2008 financial crisis, leading to trade tensions (e.g., U.S.-China tariffs).\n6. **2020s**: The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions, with some countries prioritizing self-sufficiency and resilience over global trade.",

The market cap was absurd (and is still probably too high) so really we just returned to normal. So stock holders need to decide where they think it will go from here.\n\nTesla no longer holds the dominant market share for EV's that it held just a few years ago. You can buy electric cars from virtually any manufacturer. To make matters worse, if you made a Venn diagram of electric car customers and their political leanings, I'm sure you'd find that left-leaning voters are far more likely to purchase a Tesla. This means that Musk's political activity has alienated more purchasers than non-purchasers, both in the US and abroad.\n\nMy gut tells me to avoid Tesla stock because it's simply too volatile. I could be wrong. It may have bottomed out and is an excellent growth opportunity. I think it's more likely that Tesla's sales are distributed among other manufacturers, old (Toyota) and new (Lucid).",

It really feels like Trump *actually believes* what he's saying about tariffs, rather than using them to achieve some specific goal, like negotiating better trade deals. Sure, bringing back manufacturing to the US at the expense of higher-skill service jobs is a goal, but it's not even remotely achievable using these all-at-once gigantic tariffs.\n\nHe's going to crash the economy.

So Europe will face a 10 percent reciprocal tariff and a 10 percent baseline. China will face a 24 percent reciprocal tariff, on top of the 10 percent baseline.

They said \n\n\"We all ❤️ his economic & immigration policies, as well as his support of the military. But, his foreign policy leaves alot to be desired, especially when it comes to being able to talk to our allies in a way that doesn’t offend them. He has a Secretary of State that’s supposed to make announcements & deals b/c that’s his job. The president is not supposed to do that. Trump is not good at letting that person deal directly w/other countries in a way that is not offensive & is undermining our friends (especially Ukraine), that stand against our enemies: Russia, China & North Korea.\n(Them talking about that meeting Zelensky on that last part)\n\nThen I asked them, what do you think of everyone he's hired sofar like Elon Musk and the others?\n\nThey responded \n\n\"Pretty much good hires - we ❤️ the new dept of gov’t efficiency b/c they’re eliminating the waste & fraud which was a huge problem of the Biden presidency. No opinion re: RFK & the Food Dept., but we do like how he stood up to the Biden admin & the Democratic party, when he confronted them about the lies that they were telling re: Biden being senile & incompetent. He even dropped out of the Democratic party to show that he didn’t believe in what they were doing. VP Vance is a good guy, who believes in what Trump is doing, but he needs to learn from the mistakes of Trump re: remembering to not offend your friends so that you benefit your enemies.\"\n\nThey also said that Trump's first 4 years were amazing and really made this country great.\n\nI live in Indiana, the rest of my blood related family lives in Pennsylvania.My brother also is a person who thinks he's better than everyone else, hard-core Christian, a pastor, homeschools his kids, AND believes that the cops, especially Derek Chauvin who flat out killed George Floyd was not due to any racism whatsoever.\n\nThat's my family, they are to blame as well for the absolute corruption and cruelty in this country and I'm so sorry for that. I voted straight Democrat. Crazy thing also is that my mom was a history teacher for like 13 years.....Tell me how that makes sense?\n\nSorry for the rant but I just had to.",

As it swole more, defaults occurred and we had the great depression. In a mixed economy (folks forget that quite often, sadly) when the mix is to much capitalist it naturally happens this way and it needs to be reigned in with with more socialism in the mix. Neither pure capitalism nor pure socialism works out. We need the mix. Since capitalism is pretty stupid in that it just says\" I only care about profit\" it wants to push the economy to the brink of what is sustainable in that mix. I redistributed my 401k into essentially a savings account about a month ago. I have saved myself around $15,000 in losses. Get back in, and that might be the best play, but I think I'm going to hold out because there is no end in sight. Oh I want to mention that after the Great Depression and after world war II we reigned in the wealth Gap by having up to 94% top tax bracket rates. This was from 1945 to 1965, and this was also known as the Golden Era economy.",

Also, the wallstreetbets sub is literally an entire 10M member sub dedicated to posting positions, discussing trades. There are thousands of Discord channels where they literally just tel you a ticker, and exactly what to set your stop-loss at and when to take profits. \n\nJim Cramer goes on TV everyday to tell boomers what to buy. Last year, someone did the math on it and found that if you actually had taken the INVERSE of his suggestions you’d have made very good profits. Almost like he was purposely set up as a puppet to make his bosses money, while leaving retail holding the bag. But yeah, one guy posting some memes and his positions once in 3 years is a problem. \n\nThe market isn’t free. Every single aspect of it is a sham to fuck us over. When you place orders for stocks, they don’t submit them live- meaning your order has no impact on the share price. Meanwhile, the hedge funds and MMs trade in huge blocks off-exchange. When they DO trade on the lit market, they’re able to trade in fractions of pennies, while we aren’t. That means they can always undersell or oversell to make sure they get the better price. The SEC is implicit, Ken Griffen lied under oath, and we just like the stock. They tried to short the stock to bankruptcy. If they succeed, the company’s ledgers get deleted, meaning all their short selling, naked shorts, and failures to deliver get ERASED. Their only way out is GME going bankrupt and uh.. the company has ZERO debt, a wildly successful new CEO, millions of loyal customers now, $2billion in cash. Sound like they’re going out of business anytime soon?",

New standards need to be drawn on what is considerered market manipulation.\n\n- Option 2: These people piling into GameStop to pump up the price aren't rational investors, and therefore don't receive the same level of protection. It's not Keith's fault that seeing someone else hold a lot of GameStop stock makes them want to pump the price for him.\n\nI think Keith's got a case.

You have no insight as to which companies will be recommended to buy or sell next week by Buffet, it’s whatever he judges to be a value play. \n\nHowever with RK, there is only 1 stock in play. There’s no question to where people should flock. It’s created a red light/green light scenario where he can solely control movements of a stock, and create opportunities to capitalize on it. \n\nAs for “he’s not recommending people buy it, he’s just posting his trades”, disagree. This whole thing started because of a write up he did in which he proposed GME was a value buy. Could that not be seen as instruction? Maybe not clearly, but you could certainly make an argument over it, even if it’s a weak argument. You could then propose that all of his public posts about this sole stock could be seen as instruction or follow up to that original post, building on its initial ideas. In short words, “it’s a value buy, and here’s why. I’ll be trading it when I think this value is under or over a certain threshold” - one could take that as instruction that all future posts by him can be seen as guidance as to when to buy/sell the stock. \n\nThere’s also the question of “*why?*” RK must have known this was a likely outcome from his following. If so, it begs the question, why? Without some profit motivation, it seems RK posting his trades could only buy him legal trouble at the point. There’s been enough evidence already that this would happen, so why would you? Granted, I don’t think acting illogically is any indication of guilt, but it certainly creates questions for the SEC, hence the investigation. No one is saying he’s guilty of anything, they’re simply investigating, as they should. \n\nI’m playing devils advocate here, so some of these arguments are a little thin or weak, but I think they’re all still at least partially valid. \n\nDoes the SEC actually have any power here? Dunno, it’s kind of up to them to decided whatever they want to decide. \n\nThere *is* a suspicious aspect to a single person controlling movements for a specific single stock. Yeah yeah, I know blah blah blah gets on the news to talk about XYZ stock, but again I think the hinge of this argument is the fact that RK’s focus is solely a single company, and that doesn’t ever change. The shills on the news will change their tune at the drop of a hat. \n\nI’m only a causal trader and have no real insight to how any of these things actually work though so, thanks for coming to my creative writing session lmao.",

It’s uncomfortable but you’re not important. There’s nothing special about you, except for the weird tendency to worship someone who makes you feel heard.\n\nThe cults around Elon Musk, around DFV and GME, that was and is around BBBY, around Trump, around Q, around Palestine/Israel…. What is going on that everyone feels this desire to latch their identity to some perceived savior?  What if you’re not special, and your desperation makes you the perfect target for exploitative people?\n\nWhere are the critical thinking skills? I don’t mean that as derogatory, I mean the actual skillset, the actual critical thinking and rational thinking toolkit. It’s an actual system. It’s always been this way I’m sure but Jesus Christ bro. It is so bad out here right now",

People like to talk about this dip being different but in reality nobody knows as the market is a combination of speculations. \n\nIntel could continue to drop the ball and collapse entirely. Or it could recover. It’s hard to say because the changes that are necessary need to take place over a long timespan. AMDs Zen architecture didn’t magically happen overnight and the consumer market didn’t adore it until the release of Zen 2.\n\nI say this as someone who bought AMD in 2016. If you’ve got the funds to gamble over a long term scale then I would personally buy the dip. Cause frankly the same arguments made against AMD back then are getting regurgitated with Intel. It can continue to drop and I would still hold because I’m looking at a time scale of a minimum of 4 years.\n\nEdit: It can also crash and we’d be left with AMD as a monopoly in the processor space. Either way it’s a gamble that you need to determine is one that you’re willing to take.",

They're laying off 15k+ people.\n\n  \nTheir performance will only go down now that they have a fraction of their original employees. They're losing all the people that haven't somehow switched to AMD in the last couple years. The certified resellers and companies alike are not going to want to deal with a train wreck like this again (i.e. out of favor with people making money for them). Even if they fix the issue, who wouldn't be scared that their next product won't do the same? Their only source of money is really from the government and that project is years from completion.\n\n  \nThey've been struck with the Gamers Nexus hammer now and other influencers are piling on.
