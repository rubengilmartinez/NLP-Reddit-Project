"ChatGPT Summary:

Key Details:

  * All seven independent members of 23andMe’s board resigned due to a disagreement over CEO Anne Wojcicki’s plan to take the company private.
  * The board’s resignation signals a major setback for 23andMe, which has struggled since going public via SPAC in 2021, with its stock price falling from $10 to as low as $0.30.
  * Resigning board members, including Roelof Botha of Sequoia Capital and Neal Mohan, CEO of YouTube, expressed frustration over not receiving a viable proposal that benefits non-affiliated shareholders.
  * Anne Wojcicki holds 49% of the company’s voting power and remains the sole board member, committed to finding new directors to support her privatization plan.
  * 23andMe has faced significant challenges in recent years, including a decline in DNA test sales, the end of a collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline, a $30 million settlement due to a data breach, and a recent shift to telehealth services like prescribing weight loss drugs.
  * Once valued at $3.5 billion, the company’s market cap has fallen to under $200 million.

"I’m not familiar with this case, but in general, these types of headlines are a gross oversimplification of the facts. 

Companies do not know about dangerous side-effects and hide them, they constantly receive reports of all sorts of side-effects and they have to over time, determine which ones are caused by the medicine versus the myriad of other factors that can also cause these issues and they have to then balance the risk of the side-effects against the benefits the medicine provides. It is extremely complex,it takes a long time to get enough data to draw out correlations and there is also harm caused by removing a product from the market because people need the medicine for its intended use. They then also need to balance the damage caused even if it is found to be causative against the benefit provides in keeping on the market. You also need to take into account the type of medicine. Would you accept your hair falling out and vomiting blood for a headache tablet? No, but you would if it was treatment to stop you dying from cancer. 

The lay person looks at the gap between the first side-effect reported and the date when they decide there is a correlation that is serious enough to take the product off the market (or change the indication) as years - and grab their pitchforks claiming “big Pharma” is hiding side-effects. 

40 years as obviously an extreme example and as I said I’m not familiar with this case, but it is not unusual for this to take at least some time.

"Ever since Covid and the vaccines, a strange Happening.

In 2008, everyone was up in arms about skyrocketing healthcare costs, especially drugs. Drug manufacturers, aka Big Pharma, puts out ads and statements about what a wonderful job they're doing, how trusted they are, and of course that their pricing is fair and honest in light of all the research they do.

In 2009 Obama is president, and he gets Congress to address the problem with hearings. Congress calls pharma reps, hospital reps, patients who have been financially ruined by the cost of the drugs, are in debt, and can no longer afford the drugs that were keeping them alive.

Everyone hates big pharma. Obamacare is passed.

2020, Covid is here, and we're all in a tizzy about when big pharma will provide the vaccine to save us all from the virus that was supposed to kill tens of millions of Americans.

2021, the vaccine is delivered. And here's when things got funny.

It you believed in the vaccine, then you started to look upon big pharma like your savior, like they were the good guys, and politically aligned with you. If you didn't believe in the vaccine, or you thought big pharma was hiding test results (they were), or bad reactions (they were) or deaths (they were), then you didn't trust big pharma, and were sure they were not politically aligned with you.

If you trust big pharma, Pfizer in particular, I ask you to think back to 2008, 2009. Didn't you outright hate them at that time?

">Pepsi, on the other hand, may have been too focused on its other brands. Unlike Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr Pepper, Pepsico has a massive food business — its sprawling portfolio includes Quaker, Frito-Lay and more. And when it comes to beverages, Stanford noted, it seems to be focused on its zero sugar lines rather than classic Pepsi. 

Several thoughts: Please don’t stop with the diet/zero versions of Mt. Dew; they’re better than the regular. Figure out your energy drink game, Pepsi! You bought a failing brand in Celsius and then…kept doing the same thing with it? And I guess abandoning Rockstar? Monster is CONSTANTLY coming up with new flavors and zero sugar versions, but there’s like, four Rockstar’s I ever see (regular, zero sugar, fruit punch and zero fruit punch). And then they tried cans with nitrogen in it to make it creamier. Delicious! But not worth $3 per.

"> the CEO quoted in the article is actually in favor of Trump's tariffs to reverse the trend.

The CEO is in favor because it will raise auto prices which will yield a better profit margin for shareholders. It won't reverse the trend of prices increasing while consumers aren't bringing in more money to actually spend.

Tariffs are inflationary. They cause prices to rise, not fall. Want more people to buy new cars? New cars need to be more affordable OR people need to make more money. Tariffs inherently will drive prices for new cars up, we are already seeing it happen.

Laying off people when he expects a trend to reverse doesn't actually support his statement. Keeping people on would.

">After GameStop closed about a quarter of its locations within the past year, shuttering 1,000 stores across the world, the company said it’s not close to done. And as the struggling company closes stores, it will invest cash in cryptocurrencies.

>GameStop revealed in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it expects to close a “significant number” of additional locations in the coming months, although the “specific set of stores has not been identified for closure.”

>A majority of the closures occurred in its biggest market, the United States, with 590 locations shutting down and reducing its store count to 2,325 as of February 1. More than 330 locations closed across Europe, plus nearly 50 stores in Canada and Australia.

>Globally, 3,203 GameStops remain — down drastically from its peak of about 6,000 a decade ago.

>GameStop has closed hundreds of stores over the past several years because it has struggled to adapt to customers’ changing habits of buying games online and streaming. The company was also center of the “meme stock” craze in 2021, which briefly boosted its stock.

>GameStop joins a number of other well-known retailers closing stores or completely disappearing, including Joann, Forever 21, Kohl’s and Macy’s. Among the reasons contributing to the retail exodus is continuing inflationary pressure on consumers’ wallets, pressure from private equity and retailers not quickly adapting to changing shopping habits.

>As part of GameStop’s pivot away from retail, the company also said that it’s getting into bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, announcing that a “portion of our cash or future debt and equity issuances” might be invested in the digital currency.

>“The pivot to bitcoin is really a defense against irrelevance,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail told CNN, adding that it’s “an odd thing as it’s basically saying the strategy isn’t retail but to act as some kind of cryptocurrency investment vehicle.”",29,2025-03-29T04:58:02,GameStop is closing a ‘significant number’ of stores and will invest heavily in bitcoin,business,gamester close quarter location past year shuttering store world company say close struggle company close store invest cash cryptocurrencie gamester reveal regulatory filing tuesday expect close significant number additional location come month specific set store identify closure majority closure occur big market united states location shut reduce store count february locations close europe plus nearly store canada australia globally gamestop remain drastically peak decade ago gamester close hundred store past year struggle adapt customer change habit buy game online stream company center meme stock craze briefly boost stock gamester join number know retailer close store completely disappear include joann forever kohl macy reason contribute retail exodus continue inflationary pressure consumer wallet pressure private equity retailer quickly adapt change shopping habit gamester pivot away retail company say get bitch treasury reserve asset announce portion cash future debt equity issuance invest digital currency pivot bitch defense irrelevance neil saunders analyst globaldata retail tell add odd thing basically say strategy retail act kind cryptocurrency investment vehicle,"> gamestop close quarter location past year shuttering store world company say close struggle company close store invest cash cryptocurrencie

"**How GameStop Could Innovate (Just Spitballing)**  

That’s a tough question, but I feel like GameStop could definitely try new things and innovate. Just some ideas:  

- Add **video game rentals**  
- **Host events & build community**  
  - Each GameStop could have a **Discord** and a **calendar of events**  
- **Console & video game repair** services  
- Get more into **tabletop gaming**  
- Partner with **DoorDash** for game deliveries  
- **Rentable games via DoorDash**  
- Offer **catering & event services**  
  - Imagine GameStop helping set up a **LAN party** with consoles, games, and accessories. Niche, but could work  
- **More gaming accessories by category**  
  - **Mobile gamers**: phone cases for better grip  
  - **PC gamers**: Steam Deck, VR headsets, and other PC-focused gear  
  - **Console gamers**: Everything else GameStop already sells  
- **Curated online store with quality products**  
  - Think **Costco for gamers**—fair prices, quality products, and solid return policies  
- **Invest in video game studios & esports teams**  
  - Make GameStop synonymous with gaming culture (not just a retail store)  
- **YouTube content & educational material**  
  - Especially for kids getting into gaming  
- **Gaming classes for older players**  
  - Huge untapped demographic that prefers physical stores over online shopping  
- **Actually ask employees for ideas**  
  - Instead of wasting money on **crypto and meme stock nonsense**

1. consumption & demand will stay consistent (the political rhetoric recently is doing great harm to churning global demand)

2. Logistic capacity will not greatly reduce.(edit: not clearly explained, when I say  logistics, I’m not talking about number of boats or trucks. I’m talking about the switch from container ships to bulk freighters for raw material imports, if the US goes America first it means to go from importing steel products into importing iron and coal to make steel for steel products, across the vast number of industries, there will be a gigantic shift in freighting demand, which will outpace the ability for our domestic ports to move material back and forth towards factories)

"Just going to drop this same line every time I see one of these Tesla recall posts:



Every vehicle manufacture has multiple recalls on each build... new and older. Like a combined millions of vehciles ever year across different brands. This is nothing new or substantial. It's just getting blown up by main stream media oulets.. The ones that are consistently getting called out for lying to us all the time.

 It's a recall not a factory buy back like the headlines portray by saying ""recalled thousands of Teslas"". Recalls mean you go to the dealer and they fix it for free under warranty and then you drive it back home. I'm sure any of you that have owed/own a new GM, Chrysler, Ford, Subaru,..  the list goes on but if you own a new vehicle you'll get recalls. If you own an older model year, you'll get less recalls.

When you buy a new vehicle nearly half of the price tag is to cover the new car warranty so the factory can keep up with reimbursing dealers for warranty repairs on vehicles sold as well as the anticipation of the various forms of recalls/campaigns prompted by dealer feedback, customer feedback, and NHSTA investigations.

GM had a recall for literally putting EMPTY heated seat modules in their new trucks.. like a plastic shells instead of a computer module.  They all do dumb shit all the time. 

Quality has fallen to the way side in today's automotive industry especially in domestic brands. Factorys want retuning customers not reliable builds, thats why they promote ""brand loyalty"" purchase incentives. Is what it is. This is a result of us buyers always wanting something newer and better. 

I know this for a fact because I manage a warranty claims department for the largest dealership conglomerate in my state who sells and services multiple brands. 

The resolve? Buy something built before 2010 and keep it running or buy new and trade in every 3 years or 36k miles or lease... unless your upside down on your loan for driving the piss out of it.

Ps. Most everything built after 2019 seems to be junk unless it's top tier brands.. at best.

A vehicle is the worst return investment you can make. Just try and do it smart to loose the least amount while getting what you feel is most valued to your wants, needs, and financial situation. All brands have pros and cons and no one vehicle or ""deal"" is best for everyone 

Rant over, some of the most legit advice you'll hear in this topic, your welcome.

Summary for those without an account?,286,2025-03-18T16:17:33,4 reasons why Tesla's 53% stock crash is accelerating today,business,summary account,summary account
"“Tesla investors are having another rocky day, with shares down as much as 7%.

The stock is headed for an ninth-straight weekly loss, and now sits 53% below the all-time highs reached in mid-December.

As each day passes, the list of headwinds facing the EV maker seems to grow. In addition to existing pressures, Tesla on Tuesday faced fresh competition from China and an analyst price-target cut.

Below are four forces — two new, two evergreen — driving the acceleration in Tesla’s share-price decline.

1. BYD’s new battery tech

The Chinese firm BYD unveiled an EV-charging station that it claims can deliver up to 400 kilometers driving range after just five minutes of charging. This would be a big step up from current charging technology, with Tesla’s quickest version providing a 275-kilometer range after 15 minutes of charging.

The development creates another headwind for Tesla as it tries to break into Chinese market.

BYD plans to build 4,000 of these chargers across China.

2. Wall Street scaling back forecasts

Though RBC maintains an “outperform” rating on Tesla, it cut its price target to $320 from $440.

The analyst Tom Narayan expects lower pricing on Tesla’s full self-driving technology as autonomous offerings become increasingly standard across the EV industry. Meanwhile, given heightened competition in Europe and China, Narayan lowered robotaxi-penetration assumptions.

“As a result, we now lower our market share assumption to 10% from 20% in both markets,” he wrote.

RBC’s adjusted forecast adds to a growing string of downgrades plaguing Tesla. Last week, JPMorgan lowered its price target by about 41% to $135 per share, citing lower guidance on vehicle deliveries.

3. Slowing vehicle sales worldwide

Sales data this year has bolstered market gloom, with consumers sidestepping Tesla in favor of other EV competitors.

China shipments of Tesla vehicles fell 49% year-over-year in February. The company sold 30,688 Chinese-made vehicles, its lowest number since August 2022.

A similar trend is showing up in Europe. January Tesla purchases in the region fell 45% from a year ago, compared to a 37% jump in overall European EV sales. The pattern continued into February, with sales in Germany falling by 76%.

4. A distracted CEO

Irritation is also growing with Tesla’s leadership, as investors question the priorities of CEO Elon Musk.

Musk — whose firebrand image as a tech innovator helped propel the stock to past records — seems increasingly distant from the company, minting cynics out of Tesla’s old-time bulls.

In large part, investors have blamed his growing role in the Trump administration, with Musk heading the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency. He himself has noted “great difficulty” in dividing his attention between DOGE and his many companies, a statement investors were likely unhappy to hear.

“We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin, and it’s become clear he’s now spending more time on DOGE than anything else,” Garrett Nelson, CFRA’s senior equity analyst, previously told BI.”",85,2025-03-18T16:28:04,4 reasons why Tesla's 53% stock crash is accelerating today,business,"tesla investor have rocky day share stock head straight weekly loss sit time high reach mid december day pass list headwind face eve maker grow addition exist pressure tesla tuesday face fresh competition china analyst price target cut force new evergreen drive acceleration tesla share price decline new battery tech chinese firm unveil eve charge station claim deliver kilometre drive range minute charge big step current charge technology tesla quickest version provide kilometre range minute charge development create headwind tesla try break chinese market plan build charger china wall street scale forecast rec maintain outperform rating tesla cut price target analyst tom caravan expect low pricing tesla self drive technology autonomous offering increasingly standard eve industry give heighten competition europe china caravan lower robotaxi penetration assumption result low market share assumption market write rec adjust forecast add grow string downgrade plague tesla week morgan lower price target share cite low guidance vehicle delivery relate story

"""I don't have anything to hide!""

No, you have plenty to hide.

You're just arrogant and self-assured because you are wildly over-confident in your myopic little imagination to correctly assess and evaluate your threat environment.

Eveyone who sold themselves to this company because they thought it was fun and because they thought ""privacy policies"" mattered...

Your DNA is now just an asset to be sold to the highest bidder for as much cash as possible to satisfy debt-holders and creditors.

The ""privacy policy"" you foolishly trusted, that was part of the 23andMe company, is now gone. A single bankruptcy court judge now oversees you and your family's genetic information and this judge's only legal obligation is to see to it that your genetic information gets sold for as much money as possible. 

This judge works for 23andMe's creditors, not you. 

You never had even a shred of protection for the genetic information you submitted.

Private firms sell personal information to credit reporters and consumer information companies who then sell to insurance companies.

This is a fact. This is not ""fear mongering."" This is past-tense.

We should keep the Kentucky Boycott going.

Edit, [just wanted to add this comment on another thread from a Kentucky Redditor which is relevant](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j44sjw/people_of_kentucky_how_do_you_feel_about_the/)

> A lot of the responses are really just here to dunk of Kentuckians so I just want to provide an actual response.
> 
> The biggest concern I have as a Kentuckian isn't just that people are not going to buy $9.3 billion in goods from our state, it's that the resulting consequences will be seen for generations. Something a lot of people may not realize is that most of the distilleries in our state are in small towns. They are almost the entire local economy for some of these areas (and for a few of them, the entire county). Once these distilleries start laying off people it's not like there is somewhere else for them to go work. These families likely will not have the money or resources to find work elsewhere and with little interest in real estate in those areas they will be tied down by their own assets. Many of those towns already have issues with cyclical poverty but this will just make the problem largely unsolvable.
> 
> To be clear, I understand that Kentucky is a bit of a laughing stock for many people and as a liberal living here I can attest that many of the perceptions people have are justified. Personally, I am in complete agreement with the boycott. We can only hope that there is a way for our country to course correct but I can't say I am hopeful of that.

> Edit: This kinda blew up and while I would like to reply to everyone I only have so much time on my lunch break. I am actually a grocery data analyst and this issue is quite complex. I can write for hours about the downstream effects of this boycott (from the distribution companies, warehouse workers, even the brokers who manager these accounts externally). I just wanted to address a few of the major questions people have been asking:

> 1) I think the split for people blaming Trump for this is about 20-80. I think most Kentuckians will blame Canadians for boycotting their products without seeing the nuances of any of this. It is terrible and I really wish they could understand why Canadians (or other Americans) would stop buying our products but if there is anything we have learned from this past decade it is that we live in a post-truth era where no amount of facts will satisfy their anger.

> 2) I worked on Alison Lundergan Grimes's campaign as well as Amy McGrath's and unfortunately both lost to a man who has do irreparable damage to America (McConnell). Something to consider is many Republicans also hate Mitch, it's just that they see him as giving Kentucky footing on a national level. ""Having him as Senate Majority Leader means he can do more good for Kentucky"" is a very common sentiment among R's who would vote him out otherwise. It's upsetting, I hate it, but I do believe it is possible to replace his seat with a Dem going forward.

> 3) I cannot be more clear that I believe the boycott is a good thing. I know it will hurt people in Kentucky and I feel like that is probably for the best. My concern isn't that the people who voted for Trump this time around will suffer. It's that their kids, their grandkids, their great-grandkids and so on will suffer as the towns die out, crime rates skyrocket, and isolationism festers.

"A lot of distilleries and major liquor/wine suppliers were already navigating one of the worst markets since 1968. Most companies, including the one I work for had 2-3 rounds of layoffs without the tariffs and LCBO pulling product from the shelves. 

I know many had large layoffs last week (Jack Daniels) but this will have a much larger impact. Rumors of major suppliers selling off entire portions of their portfolios. Some smaller craft distilleries were entering this year hoping they could get acquired or an investment by a major supplier but it’s far more likely that a lot of them will just got out of business.

Within my peers in the industry we are nervous, and scared. Last two years there’s been a lot of layoffs and consolidations of teams.

"Historically, generally the economy has done better under Democrat administrations. The Great Depression started under Republican President Hoover. The Great Recession started under Republican President Bush. In fact 10 of the last 11 economic recessions began under Republican Presidents.

Some cut and paste from epi:

Annual real GDP growth is 1.2 percentage points faster during Democratic administrations than Republican ones (3.79% versus 2.60%).

Total job growth has averaged 2.5% annually during Democratic administrations, while it is barely over 1% annually during Republican administrations. Applied to today’s total workforce, this would imply nearly 2.4 million more jobs created every year under Democratic administrations.

The Democratic advantage is even larger in private job growth than it is for total job growth. Notably, business investment is higher during Democratic administrations, with investment growth running at more than double the pace than it does during Republican ones.

Average rates of inflation—both overall and “core” measures that exclude volatile food and energy prices—are slightly lower during Democratic administrations.

Families in the bottom 20% of the income distribution experience 188% faster income growth during Democratic administrations.

So, yes, if form follows, we will go into another recession or even a depression, and it will take the next Democrat President to spend his entire terms in office straightening out the Republican economic mess once again.",18,2025-02-20T16:22:13,"Economist Warns That Elon Musk Is About to Cause a ""Deep, Deep Recession""",Economics,historically generally economy well democrat administration great depression start republican president hoover great recession start republican president bush fact economic recession begin republican president cut paste dpi annual real gap growth percentage point fast democratic administration republican one versus total job growth average annually democratic administration barely annually republican administration apply today total workforce imply nearly job create year democratic administration democratic advantage large private job growth total job growth notably business investment high democratic administration investment growth run double pace republican one average rate inflation overall core measure exclude volatile food energy price slightly low democratic administration family income distribution experience fast income growth democratic administration yes form follow recession depression democrat president spend entire term office straighten republican economic mess,"historically generally economy well democrat administration great depression start republican president hoover great recession start republican president bush fact economic recession begin republican president

"Look folks. Here's some things to consider.

Tesla has made profit off their cars literally for one quarter since Elon took over (he didn't found Tesla, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning did that's why Elon is omitted on the wiki as a founder). Their money comes from reselling carbon credits to other businesses so they can look more green than they are. The rest all comes from government bail outs, which are 100% funded by the American tax payer. 

Elon's other businesses aren't profitable. Twitter has never been and social media in itself is quite hard to monetize. Ads are the last line for companies to make money and Elon has alienated a ton of investors since buying it. Twitter made 75% of its profits in 2023 from investors, which was a measly $2b, down over 20% from the previous year.

SpaceX, Starlink, Neurolink, Doge, and all his other pet projects all burn cash. None of them have any real products or revenue stream. Not legally anyway.

He's done stock manipulation and has milked crypto. All of which drained America's money.

So if he's worth $600b, and none of that has come from selling products to other countries (Tesla has never generated profit from its cars), the money all came from the American people. 

And now he's interfering with the legal and political system as well as using the presidency for his little 4chan memes and infuriating the world with racist gestures and epic gas lighting.

"How do you implement something like this? Grocery retailers have large margins on some items and will say it's to offset the negative margins in compete items. It also can't just start and end with grocery retailers, you then have to implement some sort of policy on meat packers (something like 77% of fresh meat is distributed by only 3-4 players). Packers are the ones that will always make the money. With these giant food conglomerates they have too much power on if/how retailers can compete on a price point.

Edit: I want to point out that I am not in any way against finding a way to limit and control price gauging on necessary products like food. I am just wondering how the hell you actually implement policy and how can you prove something like that. Grocery is notorious for having extremely low margins and the industry as a whole is hyper competitive.

"I typed up a reply to someone in the r/inthenews thread on this article that was on top of All earlier today.  That thread locked comments before i finished this reply, and that made me feel bad, so I'm gonna repost it here.  The article specifically mentioned price gouging in meat so I went in that direction.

-

It's just rabblerousing.  It's another in a long line of items politicians know they can say because it will sound good to people who don't know any better.  Looks at how politicians talk about banks as another example.  They know most Americans don't understand how banks work, and it's politically popular to shit talk them, so they do it unendingly.

As for who, specifically, is gouging us?  Cargill is the largest beef producer in the USA but they're private so I can't see their Financials.  Let's look at [Tyson](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSN) instead.

For some reason their fiscal year end is 9/30 so I'm going to look at 9/30/21 and 9/30/23 financials.  I pulled up their annual reports to help break some of this down.  I'm doing this on my phone so forgive the poor formatting.  Also, I don't want to ignore wages here, but I think they're either embedded in COGS or in SG&A.  Either way, they're noted as increasing in each period, including each year from 2020-2023.

In 2021, Tyson saw $47B in revenue.  Of that, $18B was Beef, $6.3B was Pork, and $13.7B was Chicken.  $9B was ""other prepared foods"" which, idk.  They reported segment operating income of $3.2B in Beef, which carried a loss of ($625MM) in Chicken and a wash in Pork 

That year, Tyson saw gross profits of $6.5B on revenues of $47B for a gross margin of 13.83%.  Operating income was $4.0B, and Net income was $3.06B, for a 6.38% Net Margin.

In 2023, Tyson recorded $52.881B in sales.  Of that, $19.3B was Beef, $5.7B was Pork, and $17B was Chicken.  The company recorded Operating deficits in all segments.  They lost $91MM selling Beef, they lost $139MM selling Pork, and they lost $770MM selling Chicken.


In 2023, On sales of $52.881B, their Gross Profit was $2.631B, for Gross margin of 4.98%.  Operating Income was negative at ($395MM).  NET was ($649MM).

TAKEAWAY:

This is an industry juggernaut, and they're getting squeezed.  They're not making record profits.  They're not even profitable, because their costs have reached a level that they can't continue passing on to the consumer.  

In their 2023 financial notes, they state that ""average sales prices increased slightly due to price increases associated with live cattle supply and input costs, whereas, operating income decreased due to unfavorable market conditions, including higher Fed cattle costs.""

They're not ripping us off dude.  They experience inflation too, and they're struggling to sell the stuff at prices that can keep them in business.

This is the thing that gets missed with commodities.  When times are good, they make money, and when times are bad, they lose money.  Think of oil companies.  We didn't mind in 2020 when oil futures went negative and ExxonMobil was losing its ass, but we freak out when demand picks up and they can sell it for a profit again.

We aren't getting gouged.

"NYTimes reports that economists say price gouging is an oversimplification concerning the inflationary spiral in food prices.  Robert B. Reich tells us the real and different story below. Unfortunately, mainstream media like the NYTimes consults conservative economists as ultimate authorities.  They are not!  Many conservative economists (eg Larry Summers) get paid very large sums of money from the tycoons to advocate laissez faire capitalism without attending to its consequences.  Albertson's merger with Kroger which is under scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission, is clear evidence that laissez-faire economics ends in monopoly.  Only the billionaires profit from monopoly and gaming the system to avoid paying taxes.  Here is what Robert Reich, a distinguished economist, says:

""

**1. Food prices remain high because there’s little to no competition across the entire food supply chain.** This has allowed big corporations to engage in a price gouging free-for-all.

Four companies control most food industries, allowing them to coordinate prices instead of compete on the basis of lower prices.

"Interesting historical fact of the day: The Netherlands became the dominant trade juggernaut it was during the mid 17th century because amongst other things it had courts that protected investors. The other investment opportunities (like the spanish and portuguese ventures to the new world) were a lot more volatile because the rulers of those countries could just decide to take your money and not honor the debt.

So - what investors (and people in general) want are stable conditions to invest. How the fudge will you convince a person to invest X million dollars in an American factory if the next president (or even Trump) might decide to eliminate the tariffs, thereby changing the market conditions that made the investment viable in the first place. These things should be part of a cohesive strategy, with policies and a 10-20 year outlook. Not just a random guy waking up in the middle of the night and deciding that the stuff he heard on FOX news sounded great.

"The rationale is flawed.  You can bring manufacturing back to the US but you have to allow enough time for corporations to shift their supply chain and production.  Just arbitrarily setting a 25% tariff is disruptive because the US doesn’t have the supply chain or manufacturing capacity.   It’s an enormous country with the largest market in the world.  You can move cars, electronics, textiles, etc here but it has to be phased over a decade.  “There will be a 25% tariff in 2035.   It will phase in linearly over a decade.”    You could get most things moved in 5 years before it disrupted the economy.  

Between automation and AI, you can deal with the labor cost disadvantage.    If you know your factory workers cost $25/hour, you design products that are suitable for automated manufacturing. 

We’re still going to need to import off-season foods.  If I want cherries in January, they’re not coming from the US.

"This all feels like Brexit (US Edition). An economic policy voted for by the electorate harms the economy. It isolates the country due to the rose-tinted spectacles of nostalgia and a lack of appreciation for how different global trade is compared to the good old days.

America will generally be fine. The economy will grow. The country is sufficiently large and advanced that it has the resources it needs to get by without the need to trade. But will it grow as fast as it could? Will it maintain its position as a global leader the way it did? Probably not.

The difficulty is that these counterfactuals are hard to prove and hard for people to recognise. In the UK, people complain about the cost of living as if we didn't impose a lasting and significant weakening of the pound. Add in all the extra red tape for imports, and it's no surprise that the cost of living is up. Yet, people blame the government as if they didn't vote for it.

"As people are pointing out, the USA is already the most prosperous country on the planet. This reminds me of the time in 2020 or so when Elon Musk was shitting on his workers constantly about needing to isolate and having a big laugh to slave drivers in sweatshops how his workers barely even work. At the time I wasn't clued on to his bs that much, but that gave me pause. Like he was already by any measure one of if not the richest person at the world at the time. His workers are who got him there, without the quality of their work he would be nowhere. What's he got to complain about? How much more could they have worked, to make him how much more rich? There should seriously never ever be a public statement by someone like him having a bad word to say about his workers ever. Did he say thank you? I don't know, maybe. But far out man.

Same here. Trump is hitting all the US's former friends like an insane meth head, all the people who have helped the USA become what it is now. It's not 1950 anymore. The rest of the world has the rest of the world to communicate, collaborate, trade and develop together. All the countries of the world can actually manage to cross one, quite big and significant in terms of market nonetheless, country off their list of trusted trading partners. They can manage. It really sucks so bad, but they can manage. But the USA has now crossed the entire world off their list.

Some understand that your leader is an insane person, some go on a bit with all this bullshit, many others either try to avoid you from here on just in case, or are openly hostile and specifically boycott you as a matter of principle.

So how's that going to lead to anything good? All the other countries are going to take that medicine, and focus on their domestic industries and closer trading partners as well. Again where does this leave the USA? Something like 300 million people expecting a modern economy they're not gonna get anything anymore when most of the stuff comes from other countries. As is the case with every modern country, there simply is not any one country that produces everything they consume. Not even China does, though they're much closer to that.

"So what I see is the opinion of someone who worked for oboma.

Trump is not following a theory. This is actually proven fact that held true until 1975 when Jimmy Carter started to eliminate tariffs on goods coming into the United States.  The funniest part of the article is that he simply explains why our economy is currently broken while gossing over the details that make the difference.

He is correct when he was talking about taking in money in exchange for his knowledge and putting out money in exchange for goods.

But the detail that is missing is that our economy has been putting out more money than comes in since 1975, and would have gone tits up by now if it weren't for the $26T that has been used over time to keep up the status quo.

If we continue down the same path, we are on more money will flow out, and they will have to be replaced in an endless cycle.

My question is, when is it going to be a good time and a president willing to do it, for us to pull off this bandaid and fix the problem?",-11,2025-04-01T00:36:34,Trump Is About to Bet the Economy on a Theory That Makes No Sense,Economics,opinion work obama trump follow theory actually prove fact hold true jimmy carter start eliminate tariff good come united states funniest article simply explain economy currently break tossing detail difference correct talk take money exchange knowledge put money exchange good detail miss economy put money comes go tit time status quo continue path money flow replace endless cycle question go good time president willing pull candid fix problem,"opinion work oboma

"The thing I find interesting about all the tariff talk is the shifting motives and excuses for the tariffs. Sometimes it’s to “equalize trade” with other countries (not how deficits work), sometimes it’s to punish other countries, sometimes it’s to bring manufacturing back to the US, sometimes it’s to raise tax revenue for income tax cuts.

The thing is none of these things are congruent or consistent with each other. If it’s to punish other countries, then presumably when they do what we want they come off, and therefore manufacturing wont actually come back to the US. If it is to bring back manufacturing, then once manufacturing is brought back to the US how is it going to raise tax revenue if everyone is buying American and not paying tariffs.

That’s why these tariffs are so fucking ridiculous. There’s no rhyme or reason. It’s just trump loving to be in the news and see how his power can influence the global market.",222,2025-03-31T20:14:04,Trump Is About to Bet the Economy on a Theory That Makes No Sense,Economics,thing find interesting tariff talk shift motive excuse tariff equalize trade country deficit work punish country bring manufacturing raise tax revenue income tax cut thing thing congruent consistent punish country presumably want come manufacture actually come bring manufacturing manufacturing bring go raise tax revenue buy american pay tariff tariff fuck ridiculous rhyme reason trump love news power influence global market,"thing find interesting tariff talk shift motive excuse tariff equalize trade country deficit work punish country bring manufacturing raise tax revenue income tax cut

"It actually doesn’t make much sense. Tariffs will make imported goods more expensive, which means American consumers will buy less of them. In turn, American companies will be able to raise their prices—just enough to stay below the cost of the now more expensive imported alternatives—because there is less competition in the market.

As a result, the revenue from tariffs will decline, since fewer imported goods will be sold.

The same issue arises if foreign companies decide to move their production to the U.S.—assuming they even do so. Relocating production can take 10 to 15 years, while Trump would only be in office for four years. So again, tariff income would decrease over time, but the damage—higher prices, less competition—would already be done.

So higher prices are to be expected in any scenario without having any economical benefits. 

And also not more employment will be generated because there is more automation on one side and they won’t return to the rust belt but where the employment rules are less strict.",57,2025-04-02T16:26:38,Trump Set To Announce Biggest Tax Increase On Americans In Decades,Economics,actually sense tariff import good expensive mean american consumer buy turn american company able raise price stay cost expensive import alternative competition market result revenue tariff decline few import good sell issue arise foreign company decide production u.s.—assuming relocate production year trump office year tariff income decrease time damage high price competition high price expect scenario have economical benefit employment generate automation return rust belt employment rule strict,"actually sense tariff import good expensive mean american consumer buy turn american company able raise price stay cost expensive import alternative competition market

"This has been a strategy for a while. Republicans have been wanting to convert income tax into a federal sales tax for years because it forces a larger proportion of taxes on the bottom half of earners. The bottom 50% of earners in the US pay close to 0% of the federal income tax. However a federal sales tax would be a death knell for whatever party actually passed it, so they’ve shrouded a federal sales tax in tariffs. Consumers will end up paying that tax but they won’t see it on their receipts so there’s less association with what it is. Then they will pass more sweeping cuts for the top 10% but their base is too stupid to realize that won’t positively impact them in any way.

"ELI5 - raises hand.

I don't know, I am a non-economist.  But I will try to use facts.

It seems that Trump believes that other countries are ""cheating the US"".  He uses the term like reciprocal tariffs and you saw the figures like with China from Trump.  Are his numbers right?

With that said and here is the question...

With global business and let's say I am Apple corp in the US for this discussion.  Apple wants to work with China to put Chinese computer parts in Apple devices for sale.   And mass import these products.  I assume there is negotiation on price of the products for Apple to purchase.  Apple has the money and this Chinese company has the parts.   

Does Trump just believe that China or the Chinese company is jerking American companies around like Apple?  Does that happen?  Also, aren't there other taxes that the Chinese company have to pay just to get their product into the US.  Don't they have to pay certain port taxes?  Or state taxes?  I just can't imagine that this Chinese company ""Star Trek teleport"" the product to the US without paying any kind of transportation fee.   

If Trump and America want money for these transactions, why not just charge more corporate taxes.

"Interesting article, but I think it didn’t hit on why this is happening and what it means in larger context.

We are a consumer economy. Meaning, we need people to buy things because we don’t make them here at home.

For people to buy things, they need money. To have money, they need a job that pays them enough to do so.

Over the last few decades, the money has been squeezed to the top class., partially due to how people are paid (stocks versus cash). 

We have an economy that’s more “bifurcated” between the rich and poor, the lululemons and the Walmarts have become the market. 

This can work for a while, but eventually that gets unsustainable. To feed the beast, you need people, more people to get paid and buy.

A lower birth rate happens in many advanced economies, but is at least partially due to money, and culture.

Whites used to be 75% of the population around 1990, now it’s closer to 55% and declining. We have a situation where the standing majority feels threatened by “woke ideology”, which is really fear that everyone is not like them/us.

That fear imo is driven by people who did the same thing as their parents, but cannot afford the same house and lifestyle they had. The fact this is happening due to corporations that are now larger than most countries, using a world sized labor pool and reducing pay at home. 

It’s more nuanced and hard to discuss, coupled with the lack of critical thinking skills from our degrading public education system. 

It’s easier for Fox News to blame crime and a crumbling empire on blacks and immigrants than question why service jobs and the loss of immigration have eroded the pay of everyday people. For example, my dad worked part time in nyc at a grocery store growing up, had full health benefits and could fully afford night college, which ultimately led to him getting a job as a soda pop truck driver in nyc, which then led to promotions into management.

These same jobs today don’t pay anything, and costs and lifestyle expectations have risen. More painful still is that these jobs are a ceiling. Few start as a Starbucks barista and go to management, those jobs are given to MBA students.

In all this rambling I agree we need more people to drive a consumer economy, these people aren’t being born into the financial squeezed white majority and they are threatened by a growing population of people of different color; and culture, that they identify with. We need to start agreeing we have a problem and get to pragmatic solutions, but alas we prefer to throw shit at each other like monkeys at the zoo.",1193,2025-03-28T21:34:27,"U.S. economy is facing a long-term slowdown, crimped by debt and declining birth rates, CBO says",Economics,interesting article think hit happening mean large context consumer economy mean need people buy thing home people buy thing need money money need job pay decade money squeeze class partially people pay stock versus cash economy bifurcate rich poor lululemon walmart market work eventually get unsustainable feed beast need people people pay buy low birth rate happen advanced economy partially money culture white population close decline situation stand majority feels threaten wake ideology fear like fear limo drive people thing parent afford house lifestyle fact happen corporation large country world size labour pool reduce pay home nuanced hard discuss couple lack critical thinking skill degrade public education system easy fox news blame crime crumble empire black immigrant question service job loss immigration erode pay everyday people example dad work time nyx grocery store grow health benefit fully afford night college ultimately lead get job soda pop truck driver nyx lead promotion management job today pay cost lifestyle expectation rise painful job ceiling start starbuck barista management job give mia student ramble agree need people drive consumer economy people bear financial squeeze white majority threaten grow population people different color culture identify need start agree problem pragmatic solution alas prefer throw shit like monkey zoo,"interesting article think hit happening mean large context

"Famous - The country’s Population was over 100 million lower in the 1960’s - that golden era of opportunity you are talking about for working class Americans. 

Why should lower population in and of itself mean less for the average person and not more? 

We have a heck of a lot more consumer goods today and they’re a lot cheaper and better relatively speaking than they were in the 1960’s - I’m talking clothes, furniture, long distance phone calls, even international travel have all become accessible luxuries for the middle class. 

And yet many agree with you that there is less opportunity today - because higher education, healthcare and housing are all massively more expensive relative to wages.

"My belief is the US debt has not been national debt, but world debt.

This is because of the USD as a world reserve currency.

If the world begins to move away from this, then the US debt simply becomes US national debt. 

People try to say that there is no other reserve currency, but the reality is that with modern computer transactions capabilities, there are all kinds of easy ways to structure international deals and how that money moves amongst countries.

As trade to and from the US slows down, there is going to be a drastically reduced appetite for USD and various treasuries.  Simultaneously, the world is exploring various new trade agreements, and an underlying theme is the avoidance of US involvement. 

For example, Canada has long had things like NAFTA. This not only was a trade agreement with the US, but it was also a huge barrier to proper trade agreements with the EU, china, etc. With NAFTA all but dead, we can now move on. Not only does this present new opportunities, but will also close the door to a future NAFTA as it was; even if the US checks into nutcase rehab.

Why would we want to have USDs as any part of trade between the EU and Canada? Why would we want to continue to use swift, were the US can spy on these transactions (for the children, of course)?

This also includes various embargos, etc. Most countries have no problem with countries like CUBA and are uninterested in US policy. Before the US could bully the world into compliance, but now, they are bullying anyway, so that loses any weight.

I see a bright future for the post US world. In most ways, the more the US collapses financially, the less of a temptation it will be for the world to return to a state of US domination.

What we all need to do is focus heavily on cutting off all tech ties and dependency with the US; as this is both a source of strength, and finances for the US.

This could immediately start with facebook and other socials, including reddit. Also, include ever increasing taxes on google, apple, microsoft, etc. This way, companies would have a few years to find replacements, and time for replacements to ramp up. Also, kill software and algo patents in the rest of the western world. 

Then, tax the crap out of US media; ranging from a Fox tax, to ever increasing movie, TV, music, etc taxes. Just make their cultural noise go away. Many might torrent, but at least there is no more revenue for the US from that crap.",3,2025-03-29T13:07:27,"U.S. economy is facing a long-term slowdown, crimped by debt and declining birth rates, CBO says",Economics,belief debt national debt world debt world reserve currency world begin away debt simply national debt people try reserve currency reality modern computer transaction capability kind easy way structure international deal money move country trade slow go drastically reduce appetite treasury simultaneously world explore new trade agreement underlie theme avoidance involvement example canada long thing like datum trade agreement huge barrier proper trade agreement eur china etc datum dead present new opportunity close door future datum check nutcase rehab want use trade eur canada want continue use swift spy transaction child course include embargo etc country problem country like cuba uninterested policy bully world compliance bullying lose weight bright future post world way collapse financially temptation world return state domination need focus heavily cut tech tie dependency source strength finance immediately start facebook social include geddit include increase taxis google apple microsoft etc way company year find replacement time replacement ramp kill software patent rest western world tax crap media range fox tax increase movie music etc taxis cultural noise away torrent revenue crap,"belief debt national debt world debt

"The role of AI and technology is being incredibly exaggerated. According to some, we were supposed to have flying cars and fully automated cars 10 years ago. Beyond all that, the thing that will stop AI is one thing, which is liability. If you are in a self-driving car and hit someone or something, should you be liable? Many would say no? Then who is liable? Tesla? Good luck. Beyond that, if companies start using AI for white collar work, and the AI starts screwing up (and AI screws up a lot- ask ChatGPT to write a simple high school essay), who's liable for when the AI makes a billion dollar error?

"I disagree with only your summation, as it suggests more of this “both sides are just as bad as the other” rhetoric that I see everywhere now and feels like an uncritical handwave. The left has been trying for years to convince the right to acknowledge class as the actual point of bifurcation and the wealthy as the force that is driving it. All they do is plug their ears and whine about “Marxism”. It’d be great not to have to clash over culture, but when it becomes a matter of preventing suicides because there are increasing bills/laws on the books to ban or criminalize anything that isn’t 100% hetero, I can’t rightly criticize those people for fighting the fights that are brought to their doors. Or when cops still wantonly kill a disproportionate number of black people in the line of duty, I can’t fault them for fighting that battle either. Like, this isn’t conflict people are inventing for no reason. They’re trying to exist like anyone else, and a faction of the country believes it’s something to debate exactly because it doesn’t directly affect them. 

So, while culture might distract from those larger economic concerns, it’s also an understandable struggle for people who just want the ability to exist in peace without being killed or denied literal life-saving healthcare. As I know that gays/lesbians, atheists, Jewish people, etc have all experienced, this country has a *huge* problem tolerating anyone that isn’t basically a WASP. It’s shitty to act like the term “woke” addresses anything other than what we’ve always struggled with: minding our own damned business and letting people be different when they aren’t harming anyone else. 

Where does all this fuckery come from 9.9 times out of 10? The political right.

">Over the last few decades, the money has been squeezed to the top class.,

That's just not true.  Real incomes have been in a long term uptrend for the past half century.  Not only is the median going up, but every quintile's income is in an uptrend, rising \~40% or more in since 1967.

> To feed the beast, you need people, more people to get paid and buy.

Every income quintile is making more money.

>cannot afford the same house and lifestyle they had

That is not true at all.  The average home size has roughly doubled over the past 50 years, even as households are getting smaller.  Americans are richer, and they are consuming *more* housing than previous generations, not less.

Just about any other measure of consumption shows a similar trend; Americans are richer and consuming more.

> and reducing pay at home

Your central premise here is provably false.

> could fully afford night college

The increase in schooling costs is the fault of government backed student loans, which allow schools to jack up tuition costs.  Absent subsidies, colleges would have to price their product so that their consumers could afford them.

> lack of critical thinking skills from our degrading public education system

The public sector has done a demonstrably bad job of schooling; implementing vouchers and other free market solutions would improve it.

I'm not even going to touch your rant on race, except to say it is nonsense; America has done a good job of assimilating a variety of cultures, and those cultures have generally done a good job of assimilating to America.

"Presidents shouldn't decide foreign policy AT ALL, the Secretary of State should instead. [Here's an explanation on why the President shouldn't decide foreign policy. ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17GGzn3Ic2T5QH2oGekRmcMvFPrbkAmCFCh3aHN38gaU/edit?usp=sharing)

In my opinion, foreign policy needs to be directed away from the popular vote, and shift more towards a technocratic vote instead. Between Bush, Obama, and Trump, and Biden, we now have a reputation of flip flopping at the whim of every election.

\*\*This is why I'm the opinion that the US Senate should pick the secretary of state, separate from the presidency so that foreign policy can stay consistent and apolitical from domestic issues.\*\* The candidates can be chosen from a short list of recommended candidates, made up of nominees recommended by senators, various department heads, and the president. It can be done via simple approval vote, so that anyone who abstains won't be counted, and the vote can move forward quickly without obstruction.

With geopolitics requiring decades of consistency, a president shouldn't have unilateral power based on 4-year long domestic atmospheres. The Secretary of State could be 2 year biannually elections by the senate, with the ability of the Senate/president to call for a snap election anytime. It would establish a bipartisan foreign position that can outlast presidential administrations. Both parties would understand \*that they might not retain a 51 majority\* in the upcoming midterms, which therefore justifies keeping SoS candidates widely liked across the aisle to outlast each Congressional session as well.

This to me is the best way to handle foreign policy, since most Americans aren't equipped in understanding the complex impacts to geopolitics in the modern world. The average American doesn't really care about foreign policy and doesn't consider it when voting for president. Despite the president having the \*most\* sway over the topic, presidents are chosen based for their domestic stance which has caused unpredictability for the US on the international stage. When most Americans don't consider world events within their range of concerns, it's better to let experienced experts to pick a candidate within a pool of experts to direct how foreign policy is addressed for long-term stratagem.",1,2025-04-04T07:52:45,Senators propose Congress take over tariff authority in bipartisan bill,Economics,president decide foreign policy secretary state instead explanation president decide foreign policy https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17ggzn3ic2t5qh2ogekrmcmvfprbkamcfch3ahn38gau/edit?usp=share opinion foreign policy need direct away popular vote shift technocratic vote instead bush obama trump biden reputation flip flop whim election \*\*this pm opinion senate pick secretary state separate presidency foreign policy stay consistent apolitical domestic issues.\*\ candidate choose short list recommend candidate nominee recommend senator department head president simple approval vote abstain count vote forward quickly obstruction geopolitic require decade consistency president unilateral power base year long domestic atmosphere secretary state year biannually election senate ability senate president snap election anytime establish bipartisan foreign position outlast presidential administration party understand retain majority upcoming midterm justifie keep sos candidate widely like aisle outlast congressional session good way handle foreign policy americans equip understand complex impact geopolitic modern world average american care foreign policy consider vote president despite president have \*most\ sway topic president choose base domestic stance cause unpredictability international stage americans consider world event range concern well let experienced expert pick candidate pool expert direct foreign policy address long term stratagem,"president decide foreign policy secretary state instead explanation president decide foreign policy https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17ggzn3ic2t5qh2ogekrmcmvfprbkamcfch3ahn38gau/edit?usp=share

"To a point it is. Congress delegated authority to the president in emergency situations and some others. With the idea that the president would act like a sane person and could react to threats faster than Congress. Then Congress would codify them.

Like with most such things it is sort of just taken as a presidential power at this point. Congress should be able to take it back at any time by canceling the emergency or just repealing the underlying orders. Although Trump would never sign off on that.

One could challenge the nature of the emergency. As it seems a stretch to just be able to come in and say the words and there it is. Just because there are problems does not mean there is an emergency. This seems like it was meant as a shield, not a sword. Like a country does something against the US and the president can respond right away. It was not supposed to be declare an emergency and go nuts with tariffs.

"I go to the Fox News website often to just read their spin on stories and the reader comments. This is all par for the course. It’s mostly a tabloid rag with some bullshit headlines. They focus a lot on true crime, murders, untimely deaths. Stuff that you’d find in your local paper or see on local news, but also stuff that doesn’t make sense to have in the national news. 

What is hilarious to me is that when they can’t find a pro Trump spin for a headline story that every other news outlet is reporting on they do one of two things:

"Sadly, the only way to make some folks understand is when THEY feel it themselves. 

That why those who care should do everything they can. Not just making jokes or talking shit on reddit. Things include but are not limited to:

1. Vote and be politically active. Political activism isn't just the vote but the whole process. Every bit helps be it going to your local town hall, helping any campaign, or contacting your local representatives.

2. Defy in every legal way possible: Put more in your 401K/IRA/Roth so as to reduce your taxes to the Fed. Donate (tax deductible) to anti-MAGA organization, pro-democracy orgs,  or donate to your local community. Realize capital losses against capital gains or earned income ($3K max per year against non-cap gains). Reinvest in your business rather than take profits. Work overseas. Etcetc

3. Reduce spending with [hard red or MAGA states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states). You can just pay tariffs and buy from friendly countries even if they will not be buying our stuff. Yes Canadian whisky rather than Kentucky Burbon. Take trips to moderate or blue states if not overseas to friendly countries rather than going to deep red ones. A great way to spend locally if you're in a blue or moderate state. If you must spend in hard red states then do so in blue districts. Also I'm not saying to do 0 business with the rest of the country since that's impossible, but you can always go to Texas or Nevada rather than Kentucky or OKC. You can buy other products made Texas but avoid Telsa. 

4. Don't spend with GOP/MAGA donor companies for example Coke or Tesla. You can choose different brands or alternative. Certainly you don't have to pay for their brand premium and save with generic. Alternatively you can rely more on yourself, consume less, and/or work with businesses in your local community.

5. Buy/spend what you need and cut unnecessary spending/consumption. Fed is paying 4% and stocks are falling. Do more DIY repairs/building (Trump wanted more Made in USA right?) rather than buying, spend more time with your family rather than on tiktok, spend less time on facebook but more with friends, do non-profit work for your local community rather than buying useless crap you don't need, invest in your health by working out or taking a strolling the park rather than drinking Budweiser beer, etcetcetc.",36,2025-04-04T04:06:38,Fox News Criticized After Stock Ticker Removed During Trump Tariff Tumble,Economics,sadly way folk understand feel care make joke talk shit geddit thing include limited vote politically active political activism vote process bit help go local town hall help campaign contact local representative defy legal way possible 401k ira roth reduce taxis feed donate tax deductible anti manga organization pro democracy org donate local community realize capital loss capital gain earn income max year non cap gain reinvest business profit work overseas etcetc reduce spend hard red manga states](https://en.wikipedia.org wiki red_states_and_blue_state pay tariff buy friendly country buy stuff yes canadian whisky kentucky burton trip moderate blue state overseas friendly country go deep red one great way spend locally blue moderate state spend hard red state blue district pm say business rest country impossible texas nevada kentucky orc buy product texas avoid tulsa spend manga donor company example coke tesla choose different brand alternative certainly pay brand premium save generic alternatively rely consume indoor work business local community buy spend need cut unnecessary spending consumption feed pay stock fall day repair building trump want right buying spend time family tito spend time facebook friend non profit work local community buy useless crap need invest health working take stroll park drink budweis beer etcetcetc,"sadly way folk understand feel

"What most Americans do not realize is just how difficult it is to secure a tourist visa to the US unless you are from one of the few developed nations. Which means the potential tourist base is pretty small. It is also harder for US to attract tourists because it is far from Asia, Africa and Europe so tickets are expensive. On top of all this, if you put up more barriers to getting a visa, tourists will pick one of thousands of other destinations.

"The article is a little ridiculous in its attribution of this to the Trump administration because the case was filed by the states, before the Trump administration came into office, and currently the Trump administration is the listed defendant (for whatever that's worth).

The low payments being described in the article were not the original payment schedules. Those original schedules would have been modified by the SAVE act in March 2024, but that was mostly frozen by court cases and injunctions. This article has the appeals court agreeing with the district court in enjoining the loan forgiveness. Per the ruling: 

>The statute’s text and structure require ICR plans to be designed for a borrower to pay his or her loan balance in full through payments that can fluctuate based on income during the payment term. The power Congress gave the Secretary in 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1) to create repayment plans means **the Secretary must design ICR plans leading to actual repayment of the loans.**

>...The Secretary has gone well beyond this authority by designing a plan where loans are largely forgiven rather than repaid. We thus affirm
the entry of the preliminary injunction...

You can like or dislike this-- but its not an action taken by the Trump administration, it has gone before two different courts who have found that it is likely that the states will succeed here, and that the SAVE act should not go into effect until a final ruling is made.

"It's wild how fast student loan repayments can escalate, especially for millennials who are already juggling a bunch of financial pressures. The surge from $500 to $5,000 is not just a statistic; it hits hard when you consider other rising costs like housing and healthcare. 

What’s even more concerning is the psychological impact—financial panic isn’t just a meme on TikTok but a real phenomenon. Many are feeling trapped, weighing the options between deferring payments and the looming interest. It might spark a broader conversation on financial literacy, too. Understanding how compounding interest and payment plans work could really help folks navigate this mess. 

Maybe it’s time for a reevaluation of how we manage student debt—policies that foster more sustainable pathways to repayment could ease a lot of stress. That's where the economic discussion becomes critical.

"There's a lot of focus on unrealized cap gains lately, but my personal preference is more on inheritance taxes and reforming money in politics. 

I don't particularly care how much money one amasses in life. But I *do* care that we don't create aristocracies transcending time and creating generations of useless ""socialites"" and nepo-babies who impose their will on us with endless money in politics. I think such a thing is toxic for democratic societies and overall economic mobility.

For estates exceeding a certain threshold (say $100M or more), I'd like to see hard caps of $5M per inheritor. Anything not disbursed would be taxed at 100% to the government. 

Additionally, to bypass the possibility of loopholes (e.g. giving $5M to multiple ""charitable"" entities whose only employees are family), I'd like for additional taxes to be levied on individual inheritances if they cross a certain percentage of the estate being disbursed. 

So if 30% of the estate was disbursed to inheritors, perhaps there's an additional 30% tax on those disbursements. If it's 80%, maybe it's as high as 80%. The exact proportions can be finessed to what makes most sense. I've always thought this was what we needed more than anything else but I'm also not an economist. So I'm willing to accept that this might be a braindead take with a lot of unintended economic consequences.",15,2024-08-27T13:18:29,Should the world's richest 1% - who gained $42 trillion in a decade - be taxed more?,Economics,lot focus unrealize cap gain lately personal preference inheritance taxis reform money politic particularly care money amass life care create aristocracy transcend time create generation useless socialite nero baby impose endless money politic think thing toxic democratic society overall economic mobility estate exceed certain threshold cd like hard cap inheritor disburse tax government additionally bypass possibility loophole edge give multiple charitable entity employee family cd like additional taxis levy individual inheritance cross certain percentage estate disburse estate disburse inheritor additional tax disbursement maybe high exact proportion finesse make sense ave thought need pm economist pm willing accept brand lot unintended economic consequence,"lot focus unrealize cap gain lately personal preference inheritance taxis reform money politic

[As of 2012](https://ballotpedia.org/Net_worth_of_United_States_Senators_and_Representatives) (latest data available, we should really force another review somehow):

* US Congress average worth: $7,888,502 
* US Senate average worth: $14,013,596  

* US Senate Democrats average: $13,566,333 
* US Senate Republicans average: $6,956,438

[US Senate salary](https://www.senate.gov/senators/SenateSalariesSince1789.htm) (not average, set across the board): $174,000.

Average of $8M - $14M on a salary of $174k.

I know software engineers at Google who have been pulling in more salary and more stock options, for 10 years, who aren’t even close to those numbers.  The only ones that are, made significant returns in the stock market.

1. Public service positions should not be seen as a way to get rich, nor used that way.
2. Term limits.  Preferably tied to a few factors independent of office - say, 10-12 years so they can serve under both parties Presidents, but also some metrics for doing their job well and restrictions on time / money spent campaigning for re-election vs working.
3. While I’m smoking this crack pipe and dreaming of things they’ll never pass into law anytime soon, let’s also throw in some restrictions on age.  If you get elected at 55 after retiring from work, good for you.  Serving till 67 or so is fine.  If you got elected at 25 and have stayed in office for 50+ years by running unopposed, gerrymandering, consolidating power, etc, no.  If you’re older than literally half or more of the average nursing home residents, it’s time to step down (looking at you, 85+ year old representatives and senators).  We could tie this one to “no older than the country’s median life expectancy plus X standard deviations” or “median life expectancy - 10%” or something.  Incentivize them to make improvements for all in order to stay in office longer.

Now, that’s not to say I don’t appreciate the job they do.  I’m not trying to undersell the complexities of law or difficulty in hashing things out with eternal compromises.  Pay our representatives fairly and competitively, perhaps based on a % or multiplier of the median cost of living in their state.

"The title for this post is misleading.

Trump plans 10% *additional* tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of the already high existing tariff on Chinese goods. Then, he will be adding 25% for imports from Mexican and Canadian goods.

The reason cited for this tariff was the influx of drugs, particularly fentanyl.

I'm personally not sure if tariffs will be effective for any of those purposes, but the tariff on Canada and Mexico will definitely violate our United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that was put in placed since 2020 that allows duty-free goods movements.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them. 

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

"It seems yall have a misunderstanding of how this all works.

First, in your Robinhood agreement there is a clause allowing them to restrict trades for basically any reason at all. 

Second, they are not market makers and dont have a seat on the NYSE.  This means they send your trade to a market maker to fulfill.  They do this because they make money off of order flow.

Who do the orders go through?  Two Sigma, Citadel, and Virtu, amongst others.

Those market makers decide what order flow they will accept.  They can tell any ""Broker"" (which is what Robin Hood is) that they will not accept any type of order they choose.  Thats not technically manipulation.

If you have a seat on the NYSE or you are a market maker, you can still buy or sell GME whenever you want.

Complain all youd like, this is 100% legal, and Ive been telling people how dangerous this is for days and everyone downvotes me to the grave.

I think its fucked and shady 100%.  I want to stick it to the man.  But you need to know how to play the game to win it, and too many of you are inexperienced traders to play it right.

If you all wanted to start a WSB market maker with a seat on the NYSE you could pay the roughly $100,000 to get the seat and pay the respective compliance costs, then build the trading platform to do it.  Its actually not even that hard to do.

Edit:  I 100% think this behavior is immoral and shitty, I am just trying to help people understand what is going on.  Fuck these guys.

Edit 2:  Turns out they couldnt send orders through the intermediaries bc they were requiring excess capital to continue transacting.  Robin hood drew all their credit lines down and lacked the liquidity to pony up dough to the intermediaries to transact.  Sounds like Robin Hood isnt well funded enough and Citadel et all knew they could cut them off by forcing them to add excess capital.",98,2021-01-28T17:40:10,"Robinhood, Interactive Brokers restrict trading in GameStop stock and options",finance,misunderstand work robinhood agreement clause allow restrict trade basically reason market maker seat nose mean send trade market maker fulfill money order flow order sigma citadel virtu market maker decide order flow accept tell broker robin hood accept type order choose technically manipulation seat nose market maker buy sell want complain like legal tell people dangerous day downvote grave think fuck shady want stick man need know play game win inexperienced trader play right want start web market maker seat nose pay roughly seat pay respective compliance cost build trading platform actually hard edit think behavior immoral shitty try help people understand go fuck guy edit turn send order intermediary require excess capital continue transact robin hood draw credit line lack liquidity pony dough intermediary transact sound like robin hood funded citadel knew cut force add excess capital,"y misunderstanding work

Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**


*Question 41
Q: What about short positions?
A: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.*

"> At the White House, President Joe Biden’s top aides have circulated plans for a fund to finance national security interests. And former President Donald Trump recently called for a similar state-owned investment fund to finance “great national endeavors” during a campaign stop at the Economic Club of New York.

That’s not a sovereign wealth fund. A sovereign wealth fund is where a state sells nationally owned commodities (typically oil) and invests the profits in stocks, bonds, etc. then pays out profits to the country’s citizens as shareholders. Norway, the UAE, Alaska, etc. fit into this model. 

What Trump and Biden are proposing is just a roundabout way of selling more Treasury bonds (increasing the national debt) and distributing funds to key swing state voters. It’s no different from issuing more Treasury bonds except there’s less bipartisan oversight.

> It is unclear how an American fund would be funded or how it would operate.

The dividend comes from the investment fund the taxes are deposited in. The fund has been, in the opinion of many residents, criminally mismanaged. Between the mismanagement and the state’s current fiscal crisis, the dividend is at real risk of being ending in our lifetimes. One of the largest mistakes with the fund was allowing the state legislature to have some control over it.

Edit: the other issue is that the fund is from tax revenue of resource extraction on state lands. The vast majority of new leases and exploration are happening on federal lands.

Bailouts, if they go out, should only go to large companies that failures threaten the system as a whole. The bailouts aren’t free either. They’re interest bearing loans. They should be penalized for requiring a bailout. I’d entertain non interest bearing loans after all other means are exhausted (including executives foregoing salaries) if they’re used only and specifically for extending payroll to non-executives. 

Alternatively, small businesses that employ middle class people should have government non interest bearing loans/bailouts widely available.

"Russia is already violating treaties. They claim the Minsk agreements don'tmatter, they ignored the Budapest Memorandum (Ukraine gave up 1400 nukes for Russian assurances they would never invade) among others. Putin has made it clear that treaties don't matter to him.

You're more likely to see NATO become *more* relevant as Russia gets more agressive. It's almost entirely an organization to keep Russia in check, and more countries will be far more interested in joining and/or supporting after this naked aggression.

What do you think them having a decentralized currency would do? They would be able to trade with each other and that's it. That loses value quickly when you can't export anything or import raw materials. It's not like the rest of the world wouldn't know what currency they were using. Or they could bet everything on an unstable, volatile crypto route, which can simply be denied in most markets, and could easily result in far more rapid declines in their buying power.

Russia's allegiance has always been to Russia and only Russia.

The reality is Discover is a card and a processor. It is a vertical integration for the bank--Capital One.

Visa, MC and AMEX needs a more integrated competitor and consumers, especially small businesses  will benefit. Processing fees are out of hand--there needs to be more competition in the processing business. A deeper pocket with a lot of cards--Capital One--can propel Discover into a LOT more processing business.

Warren is just mouthing off. Cardholders have plenty of choices and this merger will not significantly change that. It is the people that take the cards for payment that need to see more competition and making Discover stronger will help bring pressure on processing fee.",12,2024-02-21T18:41:18,Elizabeth Warren urges regulators to block Capital One’s takeover of Discover,finance,reality discover card processor vertical integration bank capital visa alex need integrate competitor consumer especially small business benefit processing fee hand need competition process business deep pocket lot card capital propel discover lot processing business warren mouth cardholder plenty choice merger significantly change people card payment need competition make discover strong help bring pressure processing fee,"

"Top Wall Street institutions are preparing for a severe future of global warming that blows past the temperature limits agreed to by more than 190 nations a decade ago, industry documents show.

The big banks' acknowledgment that the world is likely to fail at preventing warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels is spelled out in obscure reports for clients, investors and trade association members. Most were published after the reelection of President Donald Trump, who is seeking to repeal federal policies that support clean energy while [turbocharging the production of oil, gas and coal](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/01/23/how-trumps-executive-orders-could-tilt-us-energy-markets-00200125) — the main sources of global warming.

"These kinds of timelines are based not our economy’s *potential* performance but on the history of its actual performance so far. The projection only works if trends continue as they have.

This track record is something we will need to reevaluate in light of a transformative new development just over the horizon: the invention and implementation of a Universal Income (UBI).

Most people talking about UBI see it as a welfare policy—or a safety net for workers displaced by robots in the future. These framings cause us to miss something far more important: the radical economic and environmental implications of labor-free spending money.

UBI enables a startling new perspective on the cause of our current environmental crisis: not excessive consumption but unnecessary employment. Without realizing it, we have been overworking ourselves and damaging our environment as a byproduct.

In our monetary system, the relationship between money and work makes our economy wasteful by design. In order to allow people to consume, we first have to come up with some sort of job in order to get them paid.

The problem with tying income to wages like this is that wages only get paid out to those who work. That means we have to make everybody work to get people on incomes—totally apart from the question of whether or not the economy actually needs all that work.

In other words, standard macroeconomic practices today is to maximize employment. Maximizing employment may maximize the distribution of wages; but deliver incomes in that way is the opposite of the ideal outcome so far as the environment is concerned.

If we’re creating jobs as an excuse to distribute money, that means we’re not creating jobs only when production requires them. And all these extra jobs use up scarce resources from the environment. They create waste byproducts, too, like greenhouse gasses.

The economy in theory could have a much smaller environmental footprint if we simply let people consume through a UBI, allowed employment to reduce, and discovered just how *small* our economy could get while still producing the maximum possible goods and services for people.

In an economy with $0 UBI and “maximum employment” policy instead, we can’t help but waste resources on superfluous work—even while some or many people stay needlessly poor. We live in one big resource-wasting machine that’s driven not greed or malice but by ignorance: our failure to institute a simple, efficient mechanism for enabling consumption.

When consumption is only allowed through *work* (resource-use) we have to use up way more resources than we need to sustain any given level of output. And it’s the use of resources—not the consumption of final goods—where waste products, pollution and greenhouse gasses are actually generated.

Climate change isn’t necessarily an inevitable result of markets or profits; it has resulted from our *version* of a market economy, an economy where consumption is only allowed through work; this creates a perverse incentive across all of society to create useless work as an excuse to consume. The environment gets chewed up in the process.

People who attribute environmental damage to rampant consumerism are missing the fundamental distinction between resource-use and production itself. Efficiency developments in theory should allow all of us to make more and consume more despite using fewer resources and being employed less often.

Our economy is the definition of inefficient. It’s designed to maximize “employment opportunities” rather than to maximize consumer outcomes. A well-intentioned but short-sighted commitment to employment itself is causing us to waste resources, hobble production, and bloat our industries’ collective environmental footprint.

It’s only *after* we implement a UBI and see how high it can go—and how far employment could fall—that we can discover just how clean our economy could really be. Climate change activists, business leaders and economists are all talking past each other on this issue; and the blind spot is UBI.

A simple, reliable source of consumer income that doesn’t depend on jobs being created is a crucial part of the monetary system. It’s how we receive economic benefit without wasting work.

The lack of this mechanism from our macroeconomic policy toolkit is very likely causing far more waste today than we realize.",1,2025-04-02T14:03:24,Big banks quietly prepare for catastrophic warming,finance,kinds timeline base economy potential performance history actual performance far projection work trend continue track record need reevaluate light transformation new development horizon invention implementation universal income uni people talk uni welfare policy safety net worker displace robot future framing cause miss far important radical economic environmental implication labour free spending money uni enable startling new perspective cause current environmental crisis excessive consumption unnecessary employment realize overwork damaging environment byproduct monetary system relationship money work make economy wasteful design order allow people consume come sort job order pay problem tie income wage like wage pay work mean everybody work people income totally apart question economy actually need work word standard macroeconomic practice today maximize employment maximize employment maximize distribution wage deliver income way opposite ideal outcome far environment concern create job excuse distribute money mean create job production require extra job use scarce resource environment create waste byproduct like greenhouse gas economy theory small environmental footprint simply let people consume uni allow employment reduce discover small economy produce maximum possible good service people economy uni maximum employment policy instead help waste resource superfluous work people stay needlessly poor live big resource waste machine drive greed malice ignorance failure institute simple efficient mechanism enable consumption consumption allow work resource use use way resource need sustain give level output use resource consumption final good waste product pollution greenhouse gas actually generate climate change necessarily inevitable result market profit result version market economy economy consumption allow work create perverse incentive society create useless work excuse consume environment get chewed process people attribute environmental damage rampant consumerism miss fundamental distinction resource use production efficiency development theory allow consume despite few resource employ economy definition inefficient design maximize employment opportunity maximize consumer outcome intentione short sight commitment employment cause waste resource hobble production bloat industry collective environmental footprint implement uni high far employment fall discover clean economy climate change activist business leader economist talk past issue blind spot uni simple reliable source consumer income depend job create crucial monetary system receive economic benefit waste work lack mechanism macroeconomic policy toolkit likely cause far waste today realize,"kinds timeline base economy potential performance history actual performance far    projection work trend continue

"Deutsche Bank's warning about a potential dollar confidence crisis is underscored by significant market reactions, including a 2.16% drop in the US dollar index, attributed to fears of weakened economic growth due to recent tariff announcements. This situation reflects a broader concern regarding the credibility of US economic policy, as the disconnect between official communications and market reactions raises questions about future capital flows and the dollar's status as a safe haven.

"Controller here, work in both GAAP and IFRS and quite strong at balance sheet creation and analysis. Built many a fixed asset reconciliation and management system to support.

The only thing that pops to mind is they might have recognized capitalization of a series of assets still with accrued liability (AP) in earlier reporting quarters and YE24, the series of AP in question was paid. $1.4B is a HUGE variance though. [Effectively, they purchased 1.4B of assets on credit and didn’t pay their bill.] This does happen, but is weird because a company this big would have a strong purchasing procedure that would use POs for these asset purchases. The POs are legally binding and most vendors wouldn’t let large purchases go unpaid because they have their own cash issues to deal with. Even without a PO a reputable vendor would cover their ass with enforceable agreements. This is all null if there are some weird payment terms that are favorable to Tesla (could happen for the prestige of working with such a company - I’ve seen it with S&P500 companies that shaft their vendors). Either way, I would investigate the court system in Texas and California for any legal grievances filed in the last 9 months against Tesla.

The Wharton Professor’s point written about possibly capitalizing expenses that shouldn’t be: that’s possible in this scenario, but $1.4B is a huge amount of purchasing activity that would normally not be bought with a PO.

"Germany has reason to find fault as an indirect headline to tout itself because it’s defense stock and EU status opportunity has increased in value as of late for obvious reasons to all.  

I suspect underlying all this was the notion the US had to shed it’s extreme protectionist status/political preference (the word ‘isolationist’ was used historically) to enter WW2.

We paid a huge human and national price for it back then. And it was an adjustment from mostly isolationist to globalist in less than a decade.

When the negotiations between Russia, England and the US came at the end of that war, the world was carved up and that meant the wealth belonging to the victorious also.  We had to have gotten a lion’s share of the spoils.

This edge was gained by the US and it led to the basis forming for the global financial dominance that was yet to come.

After the german rocket scientist hunt was concluded, many, many, many GI vets came home to obtain tens of thousands of advanced degrees in the sciences, law and finance, spurring the growth and establishment the intellectual capital pool and of dollar dominance that lasted an amazing long time and isn’t over quite yet.

There simply isn’t enough riches elsewhere to really displace the greenback.

">By definition, weakening currency lowers your currency value relative to foreign goods and services..

... which spikes inflation for the US.

There's a bit of nuance here, so let's take a look at three things to see how a weakened currency (and tariffs) play out:

* Crude oil - While the US pumps the most out of any country, we still import heavy crude from Canada. The reason is the *kind* of crude we've been pumping isn't heavy enough to make things like Diesel and Jet Fuel. Pumping \*more\* doesn't help much because it's still the wrong kind of crude.
* Rare earths - While the US does have the deposits the problem is refining.  Refining rare earths creates tons (literally) of toxic and radioactive waste.  Where is that supposed to go? Keep in mind that we've never been able to open Yucca Mountain despite decades of studies.
* Generic drugs and Pharmaceuticals active ingredients - At present nearly 100% of our generics come from India, and nearly all the precursors or active ingredients needed make drugs comes from China. The US does have FDA approved facilities for making drugs but nearly all of them make super high margin, on patent drugs.  On the active ingredient side, i.e., chemical manufacturing do we have an appetite for all the toxic waste \*that\* generates?

In all three cases because there are no domestic sources or substitutes with a weakened dollar you're looking at just increased costs overall. And of course tariffs just make it worse and more inflationary.",24,2025-03-06T04:38:29,Deutsche Bank Sees Risk of US Dollar Losing Safe-Haven Status,finance,definition weakening currency lower currency value relative foreign good service spike inflation bit nuance let look thing weaken currency tariff play crude oil pump country import heavy crude canada reason kind crude ave pump heavy thing like diesel jet fuel pump \*more\ help wrong kind crude rare earth deposit problem refining refining rare earth create ton literally toxic radioactive waste suppose mind ave able open yucca mountain despite decade study generic drug pharmaceutical active ingredient present nearly generic come india nearly precursor active ingredient need drug come china ada approve facility make drug nearly super high margin patent drug active ingredient item chemical manufacturing appetite toxic waste \*that\ generate case domestic source substitute weaken dollar look increase cost overall course tariff bad inflationary,"> definition weakening currency lower currency value relative foreign good service

"Short answer on indian generics is that the tariffs on chinese goods will not affect the indian generics. Tariffs are only applied if the 'last stop' is a country that is on the list. 

FWIW, this is why US trade with vietnam is through the roof. Many Chinese companies have been exporting through Vietnam to avoid the tariffs 

On the intermediate goods front it's super obvious that the Trump team either doesn't understand or care that much of international trade today is of intermediate goods, or work-in-progress, that moves across borders to be finished in factories all over the world.    
  
For example, US-harvested seafood should see higher prices because we export the seafood to China (hit with Chinese tariffs), the Chinese process the seafood (e.g., remove meat from shellfish) and then export it back to the us (where it gets hit by US tariffs). 

FWIW, this problem (i.e., assumption that everything is final goods) which has not been true in decades, is one reason why folks have been trying to move to a 'value added' view of trade.

"If the tariffs were one time and mostly in one direction that'd be true. The thing about a trade war is that the other side can retaliate, and then so can we, and then so can they, etc. Also that in many cases tariffs cause unanticipated consequences long after implemented. 

Like the China tariffs during Trump 1.0 - washers went up due to parts coming from China, but then dryers went up with no parts from China as they're sold together and companies saw an opportunity. They've never come back down and that price raise happened over years. Source: https://www.aeaweb.org/research/washing-machines-2018-tariffs-effect

Ultimately those tariffs cost US consumers far more than it would have cost just to create the jobs gained directly.

Clearly the platform runs on a skeleton crew, fine, but blowing out the teams, paying massive severances, and getting sued over it all was a terrible failure. 

Selling blue checks shouldn't mean anyone can get one, it should just mean the same verification is in place + money.

Had Kushner, Flynn and trump delivered the ip3 nuclear secrets they had promised early on, all of this would have been an unnecessary expense for MBS.  He could have just quietly kept disappearing dissenting voices and journalists like Jamal Khashoggi with a streamlined efficient online digital autocratic system- 

The shitshow formally know as twitter. 

Trump, Flynn and Kushner had formed a construction company called IP3 to build nuclear reactors for Saudi and Russia but they lacked the plans. Congress denied it in a rare functional moment of modern government. So trump simply stole them on the way out the door. In a bucket of KFC….

Our entire government is a Scorsese movie that learned to be mobsters by watching Scorsese movies. Just overpaid actors doing their best impressions of the characters they are told they are supposed to play. 

Trump has been laundering Russian oligarch money since the 1980’s. The sheer volume of Russian oligarchs who happen to have an address at trump towers by 94 makes it self evident that they were all looking for a place to launder the money they smuggled out of the USSR.  They stole from the people in the USSR so systematically that making the cash look convincingly legitimate literally became the physical burden of perestroika. 

A moscow street thug wears a track suit. 

When he rebrands himself as an oligarch he wears Armani until everyone at the country club makes fun of him for being too basic. 

Being an ultra rich predator is an….evolutionary process.

But your con clock never stops ticking. 

Communism was an inherently flawed system simply because in the absence of self regulation of greed, it systematically facilitated a class of those without the ability to empathize to rule over the 97%  of people who would split their last meal with you because their soul  intrinsically understands what it feels like to be hungry and would wish that on no one. And it locked them all together behind an iron curtain. 

Over enough  generations greed, unchecked, becomes the dominant evolutionary trait or behavior and kindness and empathy is effectively bred out. 

About 1.2% of adult men and 0.3% to 0.7% of adult women are considered to have clinically significant levels of psychopathic traits. Those numbers rise exponentially in prison where 15% to 25% of inmates show these characteristics.  But that number is revelatory when you sort by zip code and regardless of any race, religion or cultural constraints. Psychopathy is an equal opportunity predator.  It relies on sowing division in its prey. This was the entire purpose of the KGB. 

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/23/washington-dc-the-psychopath-capital-of-america-218892/

When a psychopathic human trafficking Russian oligarch, a greedy media mogul, a narcissistic technocrat and a soulless mercenary all share urinals at their Sun Valley Allen&Co retreat, their Aspen art society and Monaco yacht club, they become the cancer that can be traced simply by changing the search parameters to sort by location and net worth instead of nationality, race, religion or political party. (You can even use the ADS-B data from their private jets as a cross check) 

Cancer doesn’t care what cells it corrupts. It’s just a parasite that keeps growing endlessly until it has consumed everything it touches.

"I actually read the article to address the “concerns” any conservatives here may have for “government overreach”, and it’s obviously an appeal to conservative thinking when they address it as a “national security” concern.

What they really want is for banks to consider whether or not your business decisions will have a negative impact on the local environment and what social issues that exist in that area will be affected by your business decisions. You know, like what a real community should be concerned about.

Which I’m in full agreement with the Treasury on that aspect. Your business decision to create a something like an inkjet printer production company in Florida with ZERO plans on how you’re going to safely and sustainably remove the hazardous byproducts is irresponsible as fuck.

If you’re developing materials with hazardous byproducts like with inkjet materials heavy with VOC’s and you just decide to stick with the easiest and cheapest solution to dump it all in the public sewer system to let “the government” handle it, that should be taken into serious consideration by bank loaners as something that could bite them in the ass when they loan out their cash.

This not only covers the banks ass if/when the EPA comes in to audit that inkjet production business, but it also guarantees no dumbass is going to come in and think they can just do whatever the fuck they want with no repercussions.

What Desantis did was fucking retarded. He not only gave anyone with enough money to start their own business the power to do whatever the fuck they want, but he also fucked over his voters by removing the protections granted to them under the federal agencies like the EPA.

The Chinese ambassador avoids addressing the issue directly and provides misleading information when questioned; the representative gives data differing from that provided by the Chinese government, showing the shrinking of the population in the Uighur region.

">	Let’s assume, (sadly probably just for the sake of argument), that there is some kind of method to this madness. That some aides green-lit this letter.
>
>	Why?

Simply put, to throw Erdogan off.

World leaders normally deal with communications in a certain formal style. It is expected. That’s why this letter is getting such a reaction here. If Trump (or a fictitious alt-president) had sent that type of letter, Erdogan would already be equipped to respond accordingly. That’s what he’s used to. That’s how politics usually work. Such an unconventional style of communication is not what Erdogan or other leaders are used to. It’s more difficult for them to respond to, considering the disproportionate amount of power the US has. Does Erdogan stoop to his level and respond similarly and risk sounding like a fool in front of the rest of the world? Does he answer formally and risk coming off as condescending and potentially piss off the US further? Either way, it’s likely more difficult for him to respond to.

Think of this like Trump’s equivalent of LBJ insisting on going skinny dipping with foreign leaders so he could try to intimidate them with his anatomy.

"> The White House National Security Council (NSC) is the principal forum used by the President of the United States for consideration of national security and foreign policy matters with senior national security advisors and Cabinet officials and is part of the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Since its inception under Harry S. Truman, the function of the Council has been to advise and assist the president on national security and foreign policies. The Council also serves as the president's principal arm for coordinating these policies among various government agencies. The Council has counterparts in the national security councils of many other nations.

Am I completely confused, but did Trump just sever the fundamental ties of the national security state.

For example, the Director of National Security informs on the security of the state, while the Chairman of JCOS acts on the decisions of the national security of the USA.

Trump is a “**blunt instrument** for us,” Bannon told Ken Stern for Vanity Fair last summer. “I don’t know whether he really gets it or not.”

And this https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bannon-flattered-and-coaxed-trump-on-policies-key-to-the-alt-right/2016/11/15/53c66362-ab69-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html is very very interesting:

> The clearest public sense of how the two will work together — and what policies Bannon may try to push — can be gleaned from a series of one-on-one interviews on Bannon’s radio show between November 2015 and June of this year.

> In those exchanges, a dynamic emerged, with Bannon often coaxing Trump to agree to his viewpoint, whether on climate change, foreign policy or the need to take on Republican leaders in Congress.

> At times, Bannon seemed to coach Trump to soften the harder edges of his message, to make it more palatable to a broader audience, while in other cases he pushed Trump to take tougher positions. He flattered Trump, praising his negotiating skills and the size of his campaign crowds.",247,2017-01-29T10:34:16,Trump Gives Stephen Bannon Access to National Security Council,geopolitics,love throw face friend vote trump noble cause lemme help http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/is-donald-trump-a-pawn-in-steve-bannons-game piece cannon ideological game chess rewire medium landscape clear path radical remain conservative politic line nationalist agenda president cannon admit past piece puzzle trump blunt instrument cannon tell ken stern vanity fair summer know get https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bannon-flattered-and-coaxed-trump-on-policies-key-to-the-alt-right/2016/11/15/53c66362-ab69-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html interesting clear public sense work policy cannon try push glean series interview cannon radio november june year exchange dynamic emerge cannon coax trump agree viewpoint climate change foreign policy need republican leader congress time cannon coach trump soften hard edge message palatable broad audience case push trump tough position flatter trump praise negotiating skill size campaign crowd,">    love throw face friend vote trump

It doesn't help that India, like many post-colonial nations, was socialist in ideology (with ""socialism"" in the first page of its constitution) and was planned to have a mixed economy. 

Even today, India's economy is highly socialist - arguably, since Deng Xiaoping's rise in 1978 in China, India has been more socialist than China. It has more restrictions on the economy, and also double the average tariffs.

"Wheels within wheels, with this proposal. Such a proposal has multiple effects/purposes/ramifications:

* It is, ultimately, a regulatory/protectionist move. It halts a race to the bottom, so that all nations benefit on basis of merit, rather than on corporate tax competitiveness. Which countries are the ones which are (arguably) most competitive on the strength of their economies? The US and EU. The concept of being global rulesetters is increasingly being used by the US and EU to exert influence. 

* The big losers are, well, tax havens, the most prominent example probably being Britain. It is no secret that the EU is leveraging its economy against Britain, which aims to undercut EU financial services through deregulation. This could be a continuaution (and legitimization) of what is effectively the EU waging a trade war against the UK post-brexit.

* Such a global tax rate would also be a win domestically for biden, as it would actually be a good example of ""foreign policy for the middle class"". 

* Germany and France backing this move could be a means for them to strengthen US-EU relations, and to rebuild the transatlantic alliance as between two equals, rather than as the US being the senior partner. Such a shift can have potentially massive ramifications; For the US, such an agreement lends them a more capable ally with which it is less entangled and has better relations. For the EU, it would no longer play second fiddle to the US.

"Okay since I saw this crossposted here I should share my opinion on why this is a bad or untenable proposal for Developing or LDC in hopes of sparking a discussion. Disclaimer : I work in International Tax consulting for MNC's that these proposals will affect.

For background, Tax is supposed to fulfill three main objectives. One being revenue generator for the state, two being a tool for reducing inequality and third being a tool for implementing state's policy.

Now what a Global Minimum Tax does is handcuff a country's ability to impact it's policy towards MNC's through tax. For example India is planning for Chip manufacturing and wants to attract foreign companies from US, Taiwan, SK and is willing to offer huge tax incentives for it.As it considers the infrastructural development that chip manufacturing brings more important than the tax loss, ie the tax loss becomes a cost of the infrastructure.A global minimum tax rate goes directy against that and stops the LDC and developing countries from using tax policy in a way they need.

"The Trump administration will levy an across-the-board tax on all imported goods purchased by Americans and levy additional taxes on imports from countries which officials deem to be placing unfair barriers on the importation or sale of American goods in an effort to forcibly undo decades of globalization and reindustrialize a U.S. economy that has become increasingly dominated by services and knowledge-based work in recent years.

Speaking at an event in the White House Rose Garden to mark what he has called “liberation day” for weeks now, Trump said Wednesday would “forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.”

"The US president has warned of severe military consequences if a new nuclear agreement is not reached within two months


Donald Trump warned Iran there would be “bombing the likes of which they have never seen before” if the regime rejects his nuclear deal.


The threat comes after the US president sent a letter to the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei giving a deadline of two months to come to an agreement over Iran’s nuclear programme.


Last week, Mr Trump deployed some of his most advanced stealth bombers to the Diego Garcia base, which the US shares with Britain, in what is thought to be a warning to Iran and its proxies.


On Sunday, he told NBC in a phone call to the TV news channel: ”If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”


While Mr Trump has said that a diplomatic solution to Iran’s nuclear problem is preferable, military means are still on the table.


On Friday, speaking at the Oval Office, Mr Trump warned: “I sent them [Iran] a letter just recently, and I said: you have to make a decision, one way or the other, and we either have to talk it out, or very bad things are going to happen to Iran.


“I don’t want that to happen. My big preference – and I don’t say this through strength or weakness – is we work it out with Iran. But if we don’t work it out, bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran.”


During his first term, Mr Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, which had imposed strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. 


He also reimposed severe sanctions on Iran, severely impacting its economy. Despite this, Iran has surpassed the agreed limits of its nuclear program, particularly in uranium enrichment.


According to a confidential United Nations report, the increase in Iran’s holdings of uranium enriched to 60 per cent, or nearly weapons grade, gives it enough to produce six nuclear weapons, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The report said that Iran is now producing enough fissile material in a month for one nuclear weapon, while Tehran maintains its nuclear programme is peaceful.


Tehran has rebuffed Mr Trump’s warning to make a deal or face military consequences. On Sunday, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said that the Islamic Republic rejected the option of direct talks with the United States, offering Tehran’s first response to Mr Trump’s letter via mediators in Oman.


It comes as the US continues its bombing of the Iran-backed Houthi militia’s facilities in Yemen amid the maritime blockade in the Red Sea region, in which the terror groups have targeted commercial shipping with attacks on US vessels.


Mr Trump has told Iran that any Houthi attacks will be treated as direct Iranian attacks, promising tough consequences.

There has been no official comment from White House or the State Department following Mr Trump’s comments.


Mr Trump is pushing for multiple deals that could reshape global security. The Washington Post on Saturday published parts of a secret document outlining priorities. The document says that the US would leave Europe to defend itself if invaded by Russia. It added that America’s sole priority is stopping China from taking over Taiwan.


“China is the Department’s sole pacing threat, and denial of a Chinese fait accompli seizure of Taiwan – while simultaneously defending the U.S. homeland is the Department’s sole pacing scenario,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote in the memo.


Referring to the document, the Washinton Post said: “Its force planning construct – a concept of how the Pentagon will build and resource the armed services to take on perceived threats – will consider conflict only with Beijing when planning contingencies for a major power war, it says, leaving the threat from Moscow largely attended by European allies.”",81,2025-03-30T17:10:04,Trump: I’ll bomb Iran if they reject my nuclear deal,geopolitics,"president warn severe military consequence new nuclear agreement reach month

Problem is, to successfully crush Iran’s nuclear weapons making capability, it would require a massive undertaking. It’s not just dropping bombs on one given day. It would take several days of bombings at minimum.

"""I just watched an AI-generated debate about whether World War 3 is inevitable or if it can be prevented, and I’m honestly still processing it. The AIs weren’t just spitting out generic takes—they analyzed historical patterns, current global tensions (like Russia/Ukraine and China/Taiwan), and even how AI itself could influence future warfare.

One AI was dead set on the idea that war is unavoidable due to human nature and geopolitical cycles, while the other made a surprisingly strong case for diplomacy, deterrence, and technological intervention.

I’m curious—where do you guys stand? Is war just part of the cycle, or can we break free from it? If you’re into thought-provoking debates, I think you’ll find this one really interesting.

"Submission Statement: U.S. officials have raised concerns over Europe’s growing push to procure weapons locally, a shift that may limit the involvement of U.S. defense manufacturers. This development comes as the European Union strives to reduce its reliance on non-EU suppliers, focusing on building its own defense industry. A key factor in this change is the European Union’s desire for greater autonomy in defense and the geopolitical pressure of increasing security needs. However, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, argue that such a shift could harm transatlantic defense cooperation and limit the benefits of NATO’s unity. U.S. defense contractors have long been suppliers of advanced military technologies, and American-made weapons are integrated into many European defense systems.

The European push aligns with efforts to strengthen the European Defense Fund, which aims to support the development of Europe’s defense capabilities. The EU has proposed increasing its investments in local weapons production as part of its broader security strategy. However, U.S. policymakers fear that limiting competition could undermine the quality of military technology available to Europe. Furthermore, they argue that buying weapons from the U.S. ensures that European allies benefit from cutting-edge technology and well-established partnerships.

There is also concern that this move may negatively impact the defense industry in both Europe and the U.S., potentially leading to trade disputes. The U.S. sees itself as an indispensable partner in European defense, particularly as Russia’s actions in Ukraine have heightened security concerns. The U.S. has provided critical support to NATO, and reducing its role could weaken the alliance. In response, U.S. officials are advocating for continued open defense markets between the U.S. and Europe to ensure both sides benefit from mutual defense and security advancements. Despite European aspirations for self-sufficiency, U.S. objections suggest that closer collaboration, rather than isolation, is essential for maintaining security in a rapidly evolving global landscape.",30,2025-04-02T06:52:30,US officials object to European push to buy weapons locally,geopolitics,submission statement official raise concern europe grow push procure weapon locally shift limit involvement defense manufacturer development come european union strive reduce reliance non eur supplier focus building defense industry key factor change european union desire great autonomy defense geopolitical pressure increase security need official include secretary state marco rubin argue shift harm transatlantic defense cooperation limit benefit nat unity defense contractor long supplier advance military technology american weapon integrate european defense system european push align effort strengthen european defense fund aim support development europe defense capabilities eur propose increase investment local weapon production broad security strategy policymaker fear limit competition undermine quality military technology available europe furthermore argue buy weapon ensure european ally benefit cut edge technology establish partnership concern negatively impact defense industry europe potentially lead trade dispute see indispensable partner european defense particularly russia action ukraine heighten security concern provide critical support nat reduce role weaken alliance response official advocate continue open defense market europe ensure side benefit mutual defense security advancement despite european aspiration self sufficiency objection suggest close collaboration isolation essential maintain security rapidly evolve global landscape,"submission statement u.s official raise concern europe grow push procure weapon locally shift limit involvement u.s defense manufacturer development come european union strive reduce reliance non eu suppliers focus building defense industry key factor change european union desire great autonomy defense geopolitical pressure increase security need u.s official include secretary state marco rubio argue shift harm transatlantic defense cooperation limit benefit nato unity u.s defense contractor long supplier advance military technology american weapon integrate european defense system

"If Europe wants to keep US firms in the mix while safeguarding its ability to act freely in key regional conflicts, negotiators could pursue something along these lines:

1. Blanket ITAR Waivers or Tailored Exemptions

Request pre-approved exemptions for European defense projects involving any US-made components.

Ensure these waivers explicitly cover use, export, and re-export in Europe’s priority theaters (e.g., Europe, Ukraine, Russia, Middle East, Caucasus, Arctic).

Stipulate that all critical components subject to US export controls be manufactured, integrated, or licensed in Europe.

Require any technology sharing to come with immediate and full rights to build, modify, and deploy these systems without separate US approval.

Insist on extending these waivers or exemptions to past projects incorporating American parts.

"Submission Statement: 
TAIPEI, Taiwan — Chinese espionage in Taiwan has reached new levels, analysts and officials say, after three soldiers who were tasked with guarding the Taiwanese president’s office were jailed for photographing and selling classified information.

The three former members of a military battalion responsible for the security of the presidential building, as well as a soldier from a unit focused on information warfare, were sentenced this week to up to seven years in prison.

“The presidential office should be the most secure place, yet incidents like this still happen. This shows how severe China’s infiltration is in Taiwan,” said Chung Chih-tung, an assistant research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, a government-funded think tank.

The cases fit into a broader pattern of intimidation by Beijing as it tries to undermine Taiwan’s defenses both militarily and psychologically and push the island democracy to surrender to Chinese Communist Party rule. The effort includes huge military exercises around the island.

According to prosecutors, soldiers Lai Chong-yu and Chen Wen-hao were recruited by Chinese intelligence agents through a man named Huang Tsung-yi, a Taiwanese citizen accused of acting on Beijing’s behalf to persuade soldiers to sell information to China.

SS: President donald trump repeatedly claims that the European Union was “formed in order to screw the United States”. Canada, America’s northern neighbour and second-largest trading partner, is “one of the nastiest countries”. Russia was “doing what anyone would do” when it bombed Ukraine’s energy infrastructure during a pause in American intelligence sharing. Our polling with YouGov shows how this rhetoric is reshaping people’s opinions about their countries’ allies.

Unsurprisingly, in America it is Republican opinions that have changed most dramatically since Mr Trump returned to office (see chart 1). Before the election our YouGov polling showed that just 12% of Republican voters thought that Canada was “unfriendly” or an “enemy”. In the most recent survey, which took place between March 22nd and 25th, that share more than doubled to 27% (these negative feelings were increasing before the election, too). Similarly, last year 17% of Republicans viewed the EU as “unfriendly” or as an “enemy”; that has now grown to 29%.

Perceptions of Russia are moving in the opposite direction. After its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 Americans were united in condemnation: around 85% of registered voters thought that Russia was “unfriendly” to or an “enemy” of America. That share remained steady until the presidential election in 2024. Then views split along party lines. Now 72% of Republican voters think Russia is a foe. Over the same period the share of Republicans who think Ukraine is hostile rose by ten percentage points (see chart 2).

More surprising is that even Democrats appear to be slowly softening towards Russia and becoming more suspicious of America’s long-standing allies. It is difficult to know yet whether these small changes are enduring shifts in opinion.",222,2025-04-01T07:32:36,"Schooled by Trump, Americans are learning to dislike their allies",geopolitics,president donald trump repeatedly claim european union form order screw united states canada america northern neighbour large trading partner nasty country russia bomb ukraine energy infrastructure pause american intelligence sharing polling yugo show rhetoric reshape people opinion country ally unsurprisingly america republican opinion change dramatically trump return office chart election yugo polling show republican voter think canada unfriendly enemy recent survey take place march share double negative feeling increase election similarly year republicans view eur unfriendly enemy grow perception russia move opposite direction scale invasion ukraine americans united condemnation register voter think russia unfriendly enemy america share remain steady presidential election view split party line republican voter think russia foe period share republicans think ukraine hostile rise percentage point chart surprising democrat appear slowly soften russia suspicious america long standing ally difficult know small change endure shift opinion,"

"This is regression to the mean. 

Americans have always loved their allies even while Canadian and European opinions of Americans were outright negative at worst or frosty at best.

Even a decade ago, American opinions of Canada were like 85-15 approval on Pew whereas Canadians were 50-50 positive at best (and some polls showed negative figure). And if you watched domestic news like CBC, Canadians would often mock, belittle and attack American society and culture and the people (not simply the politics).

What’s happening now is that due to the Internet, that hatred from our allies is now very easy to spot. Even my not-political sister was asking why so much Tik Tok content from Australians, Canadians and Europeans was just anti-American stuff. Hatred of Trump is legitimate but hatred of everything American really does cross a line for many people, even Democrats.

I don’t know how much is organic and how much is bots, but the last decade has seen so much anti-American bile that even I have stopped subbing to many places. r/Europe was even cheering 1 million American COVID-19 deaths under Biden. That’s not just the Trump effect. That’s a far deeper level of hatred than is warranted.

The end result is that is seeping into the American perception of them now. How low is goes is hard to say, but this is really a case where the US numbers towards allies were just incredibly rosy-eyed and there’s a lot more room to fall.

Edit: To the person below who blocked me so I couldn’t respond: It’s moreso that the criticism is selective. Belgium chopped the hands of Congolese slaves for fun 100 years ago. France committed horrific war crimes in Algeria in the 1960s. Britain killed hundreds of thousajds to maintain its empire even after World War II ended.

"> What’s happening now is that due to the Internet, that hatred from our allies is now very easy to spot. Even my not-political sister was asking why so much Tik Tok content from Australians, Canadians and Europeans was just anti-American stuff. Hatred of Trump is legitimate but hatred of everything American really does cross a line for many people, even Democrats.

This is interesting, as an Australian the only real negative reaction I'd have to Americans *on the whole* is the hyper nationalism. Big tun off, cool it bros you're not special. There's probably a general amount of tall poppy syndrome going on as well.

As for Anti-American stuff besides that, could this just not be a reaction to the social media we're getting *from* the US in the first place? You're living in a dystopian-communist-fascist failed state according to Americans on social media (and your current president who effectively ran on this message in his campaign last year), why would we have a positive view of that? :D

"I assume the TikTok thing started after the momentary ban on TikTok in the US?

The US has a massive presence on pretty much all social media sites, both in terms of consuming and generating content. When the US ban occurred, a few things happened.  In my experience, the US is very sensitive to any criticism and doesn't really get sarcastic humour.  Maybe because a lot of the rest of the English speaking world had a longer relationship with the British we seem to have a similar sarcastic sense of humour.  Sarcastic jokes were made about the situation.

In addition to the common theme of joking, the content that people were seeing suddenly changed, and a lot of people really enjoyed the difference.  It was like leaving the city and hearing all the birds for the first time in a long time.  Beyond the content, the tone of the comments suddenly changed as well, becoming a lot less blunt and confrontational.  

This change was noticed by many people, and it was honestly enjoyable to see such diverse content from around the world and a more pleasant tone in the conversations.

When the ban was lifted, it was like a large number of vocal people from the US came back in with a chip on their shoulders.  They took maximum displeasure with any jokes about how the US wasn't present and went completely toxic everywhere in the comments and some in their videos.  I know this won't be the case for the majority of Americans, but the contrast is night and day.

As much as I hate to say it, ""Yeah"". If you've been on the internet for the last 20+ years you've heard every American sin over and over again, while also being told that you don't know about it. Whether it's USAID doing color revolutions or the CIA killing people or how the US secretly starves Brown babies to death with the World Bank or the horrible, horrible history of US adventurism or plain old economic exploitation, you've heard it over and over again, generally in the tone that you are too stupid to understand it.

It's a case where the criticism is legit (except the color revolution thing, it's just doesn't work like that in real life), but it's too often framed in existential terms, where ""If you guys just blew your brains out, real humans could finally be free and happy. Please die already."", because this is the internet.

The US is a teen girl who created a TCP/IP based network that could withstand a nuclear holocaust, invited everyone else on and now contemplates national suicide, except fat shaming is like the least problematic part, but for some reasons contemplating national suicide is an affront and more evidence of how horrible she is.

Not that this is entirely the world's fault.

"This falls in line with how he's typically viewed Trump as being incoherent policy wise,  transactional, and wanting to humiliate other countries he perceives as weaker. It's been easy for other commentators the past few weeks to see him as a realist trying to revive SOE when that's an inaccurate way to view it. Or they see him as a mad men when that's also not accurate since Trump lacks clear goals and credibility. American foreign policy has been relatively successful since the end of WW2 because it's always been backed by credibility (NATO) and strategic ambiguity (Taiwan) when necessary.  What's happening now is worse than the faux realism seen during the second bush admin in that Trump is damaging alliances and global security for no discernable benefit apart from grievance while causing former allies to seek stronger ties with China and India who are more reliable even through they are less ideologically aligned.

Edit: I'm also clarifying that in his essay, End of History, he's making that case that human ideological evolution flattens out at liberal democracy. He's saying that nothing humans conceive of will bring greater prosperity and cooperation among nations than that.

"I partly  agree - what we're seeing with Trump is *way* worse than the pseudo-realism of the Dubya years, but not simply because Trump is a bully who thinks everything is zero-sum, or a post-truth populist like JD Vance is - Trump doesn't have a political ideology deeper than his own immediate impulses.

What the commentariat is still largely missing about Trump, and which makes him - surrounded by his miserable band of spineless, craven dipshits - even more dangerous is this: his dementia has advanced to the point where *he doesn't share the same reality that we do* and his already poor impulse control is pretty much gone most of the time.

And since then his cognition has continued to decline precipitously - importantly this doesn't mute his *emotions*, just his ability to rationalize, contextualize, absorb and retain new information.

That not really a good take, Bush the younger was influenced by Neo Conservatives who are a well defined ideology, priding themself as a countermovement to overly cold hearted un-emotional, ""value-less"" realism (in particular under the impression of Kissinger), Realism had few problems to simply accept people like Saddam Hussein or China in power and make a deal because principles and morality are worthless if the outcome was leading to high costs rubbing classic conservative value based politicians the wrong way, Fukuyama was adjacent to neo Conservatism notably with the small difference that he thought liberal democracy would happen on it self, but Neo Cons where not willing to wait and wanted to start toppling dictators expecting that liberal democracy would inevitably take hold in place of the former regimes.

(edit btw. Tony Blair is an example of what a liberal Neo Conservative would look like, which is much closer to Fukuyama than Bush Jr. and much more based in moralism, Blair is as well interesting if you compare his justification to many arguments for action today)

Neo Conservatism as a counter movement to realism is based upon putting morals at the center and you can in hindsight see it clearly in the arguments it made always putting Saddam Husseins evil nature at the core of their propaganda.

">reciprocal

>given, felt, or done in return.

Nothing about it being an 'equal' return, just the same type of action. You punch me, I punch you, maybe a little harder to encourage you not to punch me back. You could call them retaliatory tariffs and have the same meaning.

>If they’re not equal, they should not be described as reciprocal.

It also depends on on what you mean by equal. A tariff of the same percentage on the same category of goods? What if you don't sell very much of that to them? A tariff of the same percentage on different goods? Will the income/impact of those tariffs add up to the same amount as their tariffs? Different tariff percentages on different goods to get the same income/impact? What happens when trade values change?

All very complicated, and that's before you get to Trump's constant bullshitting.

Yeah that's the risk. Canada is very angry.

"At this point, it's not overly surprising that the current US administration is denigrating putative allies behind closed doors. However, the more combative nature of the vice-president's views on foreign relations shows that there is a potential for these relations to become more strained over time.

>Vance was contending that once again the United States is doing what Europe should be. It is consistent with his past arguments that the US is overpaying for European security and the derision he displayed toward European allies (almost certainly the UK and France) when he described them as “some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years”. (Both fought in Afghanistan and the UK fought alongside the US in Iraq).

>Then Vance went a step further. He tacitly admitted a difference between his foreign policy and Trump’s saying that the strike would undermine the president’s Europe policy – one that has been led by Vance in his divisive speech at the Munich Security Conference where he accused European leaders of running from their own electorates and of his Eurosceptic comments on Fox News.

>“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” Vance wrote. “There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices.

>At heart, the disagreement indicated that Vance’s views of foreign policy are not quite aligned with Trump.

>That makes Vance even more of a concern for Europe. Kaja Kallas, the European foreign policy chief, accused Vance of “trying to pick a fight” with European allies.

"I have a weird theory. Hear me out on this.

So I don't support Trump, and for what it's worth, I was in military intelligence for a couple of decades (I got out a few years ago, and this is 100% opinion). I couldn't fathom a group of people I used to work with doing this and no one saying anything. A lot of things need to fail. Like even the 20-year-old kids wouldn't be this bad. This information flows through particular networks, not commercial ones (obviously, we realize this and point to Trump's incompetence and hypocrisy--case closed).

But what if Trump leaked this intentionally?

This signal group chat seems beyond dumb. What the reporter saw potentially was scripted--it all happened, but it was planned in advance. This leak was probably a ""reality TV"" stunt to further some other deliberate aim. I think Trump often baits the people who oppose him, and he knows \*we want to believe\* stuff like this.

Anyway, I reviewed the group chat logs, and they have two distinct parts.

Part 1 was a lot of presumably classified operational data. Still, it was two hours beforehand and wouldn't have done the Houthis much good (also, it is common practice, even recently, that foes warn their enemies in order to prevent escalation; if Israel warned Iran a few months ago, then I think we probably warned the Houthis in this instance).

Soviet and Russian propaganda often have a 60/40 rule, which could be 60% truth and 40% manipulative data. So, I think this second part is worth exploring.

In the 2nd part, they're making a case (and sending a message to Europe) that the US isn't going to secure the Red Sea anymore and will expect Europe to do that moving forward. This policy contrasts with how it has been since the Suez crisis in the 1950s. So it's like they're telling Italy, Spain, France, etc, that they can expect to take care of Yemen in the future. A \*major\* policy shift.

This leak may have been a reality TV skit to get this into either the public zeitgeist (now Trump can talk about this in the coming days?) or messaging to specific European leaders and shape broad geopolitical policy.

Importantly, the narrative the Trump officials presented on securing the Red Sea/Yemen strikes is debatable at best (example: I'd argue that Yemen is directly related to Iran and, therefore, Israel and the US have a security interest there as a result). Still, many people will read about this for the first time and form perceptions based on these alleged 'war room' chats.",4,2025-03-25T22:29:12,Stunning Signal leak reveals depths of Trump administration’s loathing of Europe,geopolitics,weird theory hear support trump worth military intelligence couple decade get year ago opinion fathom group people work say lot thing need fail like year old kid bad information flow particular network commercial one obviously realize point trump incompetence hypocrisy case close trump leak intentionally signal group chat dumb reporter saw potentially script happen plan advance leak probably reality stunt deliberate aim think trump bait people oppose know want believe stuff like review group chat log distinct part lot presumably classified operational datum hour youth good common practice recently foe warn enemy order prevent escalation israel warn iran month ago think probably warn youth instance soviet russian propaganda rule truth manipulative datum think worth explore make case send message europe go secure red sea anymore expect europe move forward policy contrast suez crisis 1950s like tell italy spain france etc expect care yemen future \*major\ policy shift leak reality skit public zeitgeist trump talk come day message specific european leader shape broad geopolitical policy importantly narrative trump official present secure red sea yemen strike debatable good example cd argue yemen directly relate iran israel security interest result people read time form perception base alleged war room chat,"weird theory hear

"https://arabcenterdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Container-Freight-Rates.png

Graphs above show interestingly that shipping cost as well got higher for Shanghai to LA, which imho does not have to go through Suez at all.

https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/houthi-red-sea-attacks-have-global-economic-repercussions/

So I tried to find data on the actual extent of these disruption, which seems to boild down to an increase of cost per 40 foot container from ~2000$ for shipping before the attacks to ~6000$ at the height when 90% of shipping avoided the red sea.

which depending on the content of said container seems not to be adding exceptional amounts of cost on the goods overall, I would assume cost as well could be lowered if routes around Suez get build up.

What I found interesting is that all shipping apparently got more costly which might hint again to the highly flexible nature of modern trade where all actors compete for ships that take the contract of the highest bidder, so even routes not at all going through the region are getting outbid by ships taking the secure funds going around Suez through the long route of the cape of good hopes, binding the available trade fleet for a longer time.

Hence very much affecting the US much the same as Europe according the the data of the graphic I posted above.

"President Putin is nearing the end of his life and the invasion of Ukraine will come to an end upon his demise, President Zelensky has said, warning that Moscow is readying its forces for an imminent offensive.

“He will die soon — that’s a fact — and it will all be over,” the Ukrainian leader, 47, told Eurovision News. “I’m younger than Putin, so put your bets on me. My prospects are better.”

Zelensky did not say why he believed that Putin, 72, was approaching death. There have been rumours for years that Putin is suffering from Parkinson’s disease or cancer. None has been confirmed, however.

The average life expectancy for a Russian man born in 1952 is only 67 years. However, Putin has access to top-quality healthcare beyond the means of most of his citizens. He is also believed to be nearly teetotal.

Zelensky also said that Putin, who has been in power for 24 years, was afraid of losing control over his people and that Ukraine’s western allies could help to destabilise Russia by keeping up sanctions and other measures to weaken its war machine. “If they push Putin, he will face destabilisation in his society and he will fear it,” he said

It is not clear whether Putin’s eventual death will cause profound changes within Russia, or whether his allies will simply continue on his path. “After Putin, there will be Putin,” Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of the Russian parliament, said in 2020. “Everything that happens after President Putin will happen according to the patterns he laid down.”

Russian scientists were reported to have been ordered last year to come up with anti-ageing remedies by an official working for Putin, who is said to be obsessed with the idea of eternal life. Putin is also reported by local media to take regular baths in an extract of blood from the severed antlers of Siberian red deer, believed to have powerful rejuvenating powers.",408,2025-03-27T17:12:45,Zelensky: Putin will die soon and the Ukraine war will end,geopolitics,president putin nearing end life invasion ukraine come end demise president kerensky say warn moscow ready force imminent offensive die soon fact ukrainian leader tell provision news pm young putin bet prospect well kerensky believe putin approach death rumour year putin suffering parkinson disease cancer confirm average life expectancy russian man bear year putin access quality healthcare mean citizen believe nearly teetotal kerensky say putin power year afraid lose control people ukraine western ally help destabilise russia keep sanction measure weaken war machine push putin face destabilisation society fear say clear putin eventual death cause profound change russia ally simply continue path putin putin vyacheslav borodin chairman russian parliament say happen president putin happen accord pattern lay russian scientist report order year come anti age remedy official working putin say obsess idea eternal life putin report local medium regular bath extract blood sever antler siberian red deer believe powerful rejuvenate power,"president putin nearing end life invasion ukraine come end demise president zelensky say warn moscow ready force imminent offensive

"I'd honestly be surprised if Ukraine isnt in the process of rearming with nuclear deterrents, despite the geopolitical risks. Being that they're the only nation to actually disarm, I think they, if anyone, should reserve the right to rearm. 

Particularly with the fickle and downright dangerously unreliable US threatening to leave NATO, the only nation that can truly secure its borders will need the ultimate deterrent. Every non-nuclear country on earth is ripe for the taking in this new world, no one is safe. As resources dwindle, and as climate changes, the strategic view of the world changes with it. For as unpopular as the US's moves are right now, its a pretty bipartisan shift. Those on the left will do nothing but sit idly by as the right reasserts its imperialist edge. The left has no better solution and while the tariffs are stupid on their face, everyone is in agreement that the budget is not sustainable. The EU is not anywhere near united enough to consolidate and provide a continental military. It is a fragile union, made for economics, not war. It very well may fracture when the going gets *really* tough for its members. Some rely on Russia for energy, others are not as ideologically opposed as the rest of the EU might like.

In principle, though, the Commonwealth is supposed to be a club of former British colonies that we freely gave independence to. I'm not sure why the Americans would want to be associated with something that they fought to be free from.

The planned fund for capitals to spend on weapons would only be open to EU defence companies and those from third countries that have signed defence agreements with the bloc, officials said on Wednesday.

It would also exclude any advanced weapons systems upon which a third country had “design authority” — restrictions on its construction or use of particular components — or control over its eventual use, the officials added.

EU member states would not be able to spend the money on products “where there can be a control on the use or the destination of that weapon . . . It would be a real problem if equipment acquired by countries cannot be used because a third country would object,” one of the officials said.

The UK has lobbied hard to be included in the initiative, particularly given its key role in a European “coalition of the willing” aimed at bolstering the continent’s defence capabilities. UK defence companies, including BAE Systems and Babcock International, are deeply integrated into the defence industry of EU countries such as Italy and Sweden.

If third countries such as the US, UK and Turkey wanted to participate in the initiative, they would need to sign a defence and security partnership with the EU, officials said.

Talks between London and Brussels on such a pact have begun but have become embroiled in demands for a larger EU-UK agreement that would also include controversial issues such as fishing rights and migration.

The exclusion of the UK and Turkey will create major headaches for big European defence companies with close ties to producers or suppliers in those markets.

The move will cause significant consternation in Britain’s defence sector. One senior UK defence industry insider said it was a “considerable concern”, adding: “We see a huge amount of opportunity and it’s right the UK is seen as part of Europe. But if the EU — and especially France — is going to be transactional about this, it undermines the entire philosophy of a joint and unified Europe in defence and security terms.”

Previous French efforts to ringfence defence spending for EU companies only have met with stiff resistance from countries such as Germany, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands that have close ties with non-EU defence producers.

Under the terms of the plan, EU countries would be able to spend the loans on products using components from Norway, South Korea, Japan, Albania, Moldova, North Macedonia and Ukraine, officials said.",193,2025-03-19T13:44:50,"EU to exclude US, UK and Turkey from €150bn rearmament fund",geopolitics,arm company turkey exclude new 150bn eur defence funding push home country sign defence security pact brussels plan fund capital spend weapon open eur defence company country sign defence agreement bloc official say wednesday exclude advanced weapon system country design authority restriction construction use particular component control eventual use official add eur member state able spend money product control use destination weapon real problem equipment acquire country country object official say lobby hard include initiative particularly give key role european coalition willing aim bolster continent defence capability defence company include system hancock international deeply integrate defence industry eur country italy sweden countries turkey want participate initiative need sign defence security partnership eur official say talk london brussels pact begin embroil demand large eur agreement include controversial issue fishing right migration exclusion turkey create major headache big european defence company close tie producer supplier market cause significant consternation britain defence sector senior defence industry insider say considerable concern add huge opportunity right see europe eur especially france go transactional undermine entire philosophy joint unify europe defence security term previous french effort ringfence defence spending eur company meet stiff resistance country germany italy sweden netherlands close tie non eur defence producer term plan eur country able spend loan product component norway south korea japan albania moldova north macedonia ukraine official say,"arm company uk turkey exclude new € 150bn eu defence funding push home country sign defence security pact brussels

"From Creepercooper :

Brexit wasn’t about European defence though, these should be separate issues.

All the Brexiteers that voted for Brexit because they were afraid of an European army disagree with you.

The EU has a defence clause. Defence structures, too.

And furthermore, this is about investing into the defence industry. Economics and defence are intertwined topics. And considering the EU is also an economic union, the answer is yes: Brexit was also about defence issues.

The UK does not have a right to EU investment. It's EU money, paid by the EU taxpayer. It's completely reasonable to want to exclude third-parties from this fund as much as possible to increase self reliance.

‘We have been committed to defending Ukraine as early as 2015’

Which is a good thing, yes.

‘meanwhile you have major EU economies (Spain, Italy) sitting on their arses.’

I agree, this is bad.

None of these are actually arguments for why EU funds (meant to revive and build up the EU defence industry) should go to the UK, though...

‘Yes Brexit was a colossal fuckup but how on Earth are we less trustworthy on defence than them?!’

They stayed in the Union, the UK didn't. It's EU money. It makes sense that EU money is first and foremost spend on EU defence industries.

But who knows what will happen. Maybe if the UK proposes to contribute a giant sum themselves into this fund as well, they can work something out of it.

But I will return to my original point. The UK does not have a right to EU defence investments. If the EU wants to spend that their money in the EU, you do not get to demand a piece of that pie.

the US has been offshoring jobs since the 80's. that's over 4 decades of corporations shipping jobs overseas to other countries to take advantage of cheap labor, and because of that everything is manufactured in other countries and imported here

that imbalance of imports is called the trade deficit and it has been growing precipitously for decades. *""In 2024, the US goods and services trade deficit reached a record $918.4 billion, a 17% increase from 2023, driven by surging imports and modest export growth"" - Google*

Mark Carney on his opinion of restructuring US economy.  

Mark Carney on Friday was asked, as an economist, what he thinks the effect of Donald Trump’s policies will have on the US economy and how it will affect Canada’s economy. It’s, of course, pretty measured and clear eyed about what the effect will be. This comment stood out as another Carney mic drop.

We have had examples when the US has had a recession and we haven’t had a recession. I’m trying to remember who was Governor of the Bank of Canada at the time when that happened. Oh yeah it was me.”

You can check out the whole exchange on Youtube.

“He’s a force... He will be tough for the Americans to deal with. He’ll make mincemeat out of the second-raters in the Trump team.

"To be fair (and I don't have any desire to defend Elon Musk) Tesla stock basically doubled when Elon took a prominent role in Trump's campaign and administration and has simply given all of those gains back. The market cap was absurd (and is still probably too high) so really we just returned to normal. So stock holders need to decide where they think it will go from here.

Tesla no longer holds the dominant market share for EV's that it held just a few years ago. You can buy electric cars from virtually any manufacturer. To make matters worse, if you made a Venn diagram of electric car customers and their political leanings, I'm sure you'd find that left-leaning voters are far more likely to purchase a Tesla. This means that Musk's political activity has alienated more purchasers than non-purchasers, both in the US and abroad.

My gut tells me to avoid Tesla stock because it's simply too volatile. I could be wrong. It may have bottomed out and is an excellent growth opportunity. I think it's more likely that Tesla's sales are distributed among other manufacturers, old (Toyota) and new (Lucid).",3,2025-03-19T11:18:31,Just keeps going down and down !,StockMarket,fair desire defend leon musk tesla stock basically double leon take prominent role trump campaign administration simply give gain market cap absurd probably high return normal stock holder need decide think tesla long hold dominant market share eve hold year ago buy electric car virtually manufacturer matter bad venn diagram electric car customer political leaning pm sure cd find leave lean voter far likely purchase tesla mean musk political activity alienate purchaser non purchaser abroad gut tell avoid tesla stock simply volatile wrong bottom excellent growth opportunity think likely tesla sale distribute manufacturer old toyota new lucid,"fair desire defend elon musk tesla stock basically double elon take prominent role trump campaign administration simply give gain market cap absurd probably high return normal stock holder need decide think

"Nasdaq Composite Growth During Трамп’s Presidency

Трамп was inaugurated on January 20, 2017, and his last day in office was January 19, 2021. Here’s how the Nasdaq Composite performed during his term:

	•	January 20, 2017: 5,555.33
	•	January 19, 2021: 13,197.18

Percent Change Calculation

Percent Change = ((Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value) × 100

= ((13,197.18 - 5,555.33) / 5,555.33) × 100

= (7,641.85 / 5,555.33) × 100

= 137.6%

So, during Трамп’s presidency, the Nasdaq Composite increased by approximately 137.6%.

It’s still significant, but it’s not 155%.

"I'm the only sane one out of my entire blood related family. My parents voted for Trump, my brother, his wife and her ENTIRE family voted for Trump. My family except for me are all hard-core radical Christians who basically act like Westboro Baptist Church people. I asked my parents 2 weeks ago who they voted for bc I wanted them to admit it. They said 

""We all ❤️ his economic & immigration policies, as well as his support of the military. But, his foreign policy leaves alot to be desired, especially when it comes to being able to talk to our allies in a way that doesn’t offend them. He has a Secretary of State that’s supposed to make announcements & deals b/c that’s his job. The president is not supposed to do that. Trump is not good at letting that person deal directly w/other countries in a way that is not offensive & is undermining our friends (especially Ukraine), that stand against our enemies: Russia, China & North Korea.
(Them talking about that meeting Zelensky on that last part)

Then I asked them, what do you think of everyone he's hired sofar like Elon Musk and the others?

They responded 

""Pretty much good hires - we ❤️ the new dept of gov’t efficiency b/c they’re eliminating the waste & fraud which was a huge problem of the Biden presidency. No opinion re: RFK & the Food Dept., but we do like how he stood up to the Biden admin & the Democratic party, when he confronted them about the lies that they were telling re: Biden being senile & incompetent. He even dropped out of the Democratic party to show that he didn’t believe in what they were doing. VP Vance is a good guy, who believes in what Trump is doing, but he needs to learn from the mistakes of Trump re: remembering to not offend your friends so that you benefit your enemies.""

They also said that Trump's first 4 years were amazing and really made this country great.

I live in Indiana, the rest of my blood related family lives in Pennsylvania.My brother also is a person who thinks he's better than everyone else, hard-core Christian, a pastor, homeschools his kids, AND believes that the cops, especially Derek Chauvin who flat out killed George Floyd was not due to any racism whatsoever.

That's my family, they are to blame as well for the absolute corruption and cruelty in this country and I'm so sorry for that. I voted straight Democrat. Crazy thing also is that my mom was a history teacher for like 13 years.....Tell me how that makes sense?

"This is a terribly dumb conversation. Kitty is approximated to own about 4.8# of GME. At 5% he’d be required to disclose his positions. Pretty fucking moot point if you ask me. Also, the wallstreetbets sub is literally an entire 10M member sub dedicated to posting positions, discussing trades. There are thousands of Discord channels where they literally just tel you a ticker, and exactly what to set your stop-loss at and when to take profits. 

Jim Cramer goes on TV everyday to tell boomers what to buy. Last year, someone did the math on it and found that if you actually had taken the INVERSE of his suggestions you’d have made very good profits.

"It's gonna be a real interesting court case if charges are filed.

Laws around market manipulation are set up around putting out information that can mislead ""reasonable"" and ""rational"" investors and affect the price of a security.

Those laws weren't written with the expectation of meme stocks and social media driven investing.

In the normal world, telling people what stocks you own shouldn't affect a stock's price materially, but that's obviously changed.

Does Keith Gill have an obligation to never post about stocks again, since he can reasonably assume he might move the market?

I see it going one of two ways:

- Option 1: Courts rule that there is a new standard for what's considered a ""reasonable"" investor now that dumb retail traders have increasingly entered the picture. New standards need to be drawn on what is considerered market manipulation.

- Option 2: These people piling into GameStop to pump up the price aren't rational investors, and therefore don't receive the same level of protection. It's not Keith's fault that seeing someone else hold a lot of GameStop stock makes them want to pump the price for him.

"I’ve posted a few replies but, I’ll try to go against the grain here, because why not. 

He’s different from Buffet because he’s only trading one specific stock. You have no insight as to which companies will be recommended to buy or sell next week by Buffet, it’s whatever he judges to be a value play. 

However with RK, there is only 1 stock in play. There’s no question to where people should flock. It’s created a red light/green light scenario where he can solely control movements of a stock, and create opportunities to capitalize on it. 

As for “he’s not recommending people buy it, he’s just posting his trades”, disagree. This whole thing started because of a write up he did in which he proposed GME was a value buy. Could that not be seen as instruction? Maybe not clearly, but you could certainly make an argument over it, even if it’s a weak argument. You could then propose that all of his public posts about this sole stock could be seen as instruction or follow up to that original post, building on its initial ideas. In short words, “it’s a value buy, and here’s why. I’ll be trading it when I think this value is under or over a certain threshold” - one could take that as instruction that all future posts by him can be seen as guidance as to when to buy/sell the stock. 

There’s also the question of “*why?*” RK must have known this was a likely outcome from his following. If so, it begs the question, why? Without some profit motivation, it seems RK posting his trades could only buy him legal trouble at the point. There’s been enough evidence already that this would happen, so why would you? Granted, I don’t think acting illogically is any indication of guilt, but it certainly creates questions for the SEC, hence the investigation. No one is saying he’s guilty of anything, they’re simply investigating, as they should. 

I’m playing devils advocate here, so some of these arguments are a little thin or weak, but I think they’re all still at least partially valid. 

Does the SEC actually have any power here? Dunno, it’s kind of up to them to decided whatever they want to decide. 

There *is* a suspicious aspect to a single person controlling movements for a specific single stock. Yeah yeah, I know blah blah blah gets on the news to talk about XYZ stock, but again I think the hinge of this argument is the fact that RK’s focus is solely a single company, and that doesn’t ever change. The shills on the news will change their tune at the drop of a hat. 

I’m only a causal trader and have no real insight to how any of these things actually work though so, thanks for coming to my creative writing session lmao.",14,2024-06-04T17:52:33,Massachusetts regulator probes 'Roaring Kitty's' GameStop trades,StockMarket,ave post reply try grain different buffet trade specific stock insight company recommend buy sell week buffet judge value play stock play question people flock create red light green light scenario solely control movement stock create opportunity capitalize recommend people buy posting trade disagree thing start write propose value buy see instruction maybe clearly certainly argument weak argument propose public post sole stock see instruction follow original post build initial idea short word value buy trading think value certain threshold instruction future post see guidance buy sell stock question know likely outcome follow beg question profit motivation post trade buy legal trouble point evidence happen grant think act illogically indication guilt certainly create question sec investigation say guilty simply investigate pm play devil advocate argument little thin weak think partially valid sec actually power dunno kind decide want decide suspicious aspect single person control movement specific single stock yeah yeah know blah blah blah get news talk byz stock think hinge argument fact focus solely single company change shill news change tune drop hat pm causal trader real insight thing actually work thank come creative writing session lao,"post reply try grain

Why is everyone so sure they’re being victimized and that *someone* is going to save them? Like what is this deep fear and insecurity driving people’s decision making? It’s uncomfortable but you’re not important. There’s nothing special about you, except for the weird tendency to worship someone who makes you feel heard.

The cults around Elon Musk, around DFV and GME, that was and is around BBBY, around Trump, around Q, around Palestine/Israel…. What is going on that everyone feels this desire to latch their identity to some perceived savior?  What if you’re not special, and your desperation makes you the perfect target for exploitative people?

"AMD got as low as 6. People like to talk about this dip being different but in reality nobody knows as the market is a combination of speculations. 

Intel could continue to drop the ball and collapse entirely. Or it could recover. It’s hard to say because the changes that are necessary need to take place over a long timespan. AMDs Zen architecture didn’t magically happen overnight and the consumer market didn’t adore it until the release of Zen 2.

I say this as someone who bought AMD in 2016. If you’ve got the funds to gamble over a long term scale then I would personally buy the dip. Cause frankly the same arguments made against AMD back then are getting regurgitated with Intel. It can continue to drop and I would still hold because I’m looking at a time scale of a minimum of 4 years.

Edit: It can also crash and we’d be left with AMD as a monopoly in the processor space.

"Okay for everyone wondering what impeachment is vs a removal of office.

Impeachment is like charging you with a crime. So the House of Representatives charged Trump with abuse of power & obstruction of congress.

Removal of office comes about when the House of Representatives vote by a majority to impeach on each charge (known as an Article of Impeachment), that goes to the Senate, and then by a 2/3 majority (67 Senators) in the Senate to vote to convict, and only then is the President is finally removed from office.

In other words, impeachment is like being charged by the DA for manslaughter, removal of office is when the jury decides you're guilty of manslaughter. The DA is the House, and the jury is the Senate in this analogy.

EDIT: Instead of giving me gold (just DM me your potatoes), please take the time to check that you're registered to [vote](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/) and consider donating to the ACLU or [Fair Fight 2020](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vsafairfight), an organization ran by Stacey Abrams (GA 2018 Gov nominee) that protects the right to vote. Fair Fight 2020 specifically focuses on fighting against voter purges.

EDIT 2:

I keep getting asked whether or not a President that has been impeached and removed from office can hold office again. He cannot if the Senate votes as to do as such specifically (source 3)

It is a common practice to give honorary black belts, with the degree varying, depending on the giving organisation and the person it is awarded to (see Zlatan Ibrahimovic).

He has praised dictators and put Putin on a pedestal above all else.

He has unethically benefited from a business standpoint by having the government spend millions at his hotels. 

He has refused to demonstrate sympathy when a tragic shooting occurs.

He has mocked gold star families.

He goes on tirades on Twitter.

He fabricates ""facts"" (like the ones related to the Queen) to make himself seem better.

He had a scandal with a porn star.

He has literally been caught saying grab em by the pussy (and said some incestuous stuff about his daughter).

He constantly attacks the Constitution of Free Speech by calling various journalism ""Fake News"". 

He has ruined our relationships with previous allies.

He tried to start a trade war.

His tax cuts only helped large corporations and he defended the cuts by saying the employees would benefit when in reality the tax cuts stimulated buybacks of stock.

For the love of God I don't understand how people don't understand that he is not on par with all of the proper presidents we have had in the past.

From the Start, Trump Has Muddied a Clear Message: Putin Interfered

WASHINGTON — Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.

The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.

Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.

The shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.

On Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin’s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.

On Wednesday, when a reporter asked, “Is Russia still targeting the U.S.?” Mr. Trump shot back, “No” — directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)

Hours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, “because he’s in charge of the country.”

In the run-up to this week’s ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.

The Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.

The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the “Steele dossier.” That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump’s activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.

According to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin’s role in the election interference.

They included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U. had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.

And ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin’s own role.

That included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.

Instead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.

Mr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.

The same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called “hand-to-hand combat” to dig in.

The pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.

After the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said “Russia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries” were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations — including the D.N.C.

Still, Mr. Trump said in his statement, “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.”

Mr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.

“I was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,” he said in testimony in May 2017. “And they were very aggressive.”

For Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.

Mr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clinton’s loss in the election.

Mr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russia’s election interference.

Only Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.)

And the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling.

In March, the Department of Homeland Security declared that Russia was targeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security.

Just last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were “blinking red” and called Russia the “most aggressive foreign actor, no question.”

“And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy,” he said.

Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, also stood firm.

“The intelligence community’s assessment has not changed,” Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. “My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.”

The Russian efforts are “aimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,” he continued. “We haven’t yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level.”

“It’s a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.”

Almost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russia’s election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics.

He dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a “witch hunt” against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russia’s role — and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trump’s immediate orbit may have worked with them.

In July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow’s cyberskills were so good that the government’s hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.

Since then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure — as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday — he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings.

That is what happened again this week, twice.

Mr. Trump’s statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack.

That contributed to Mr. Trump’s decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered — although he also veered off script to declare: “Could be other people also. A lot of people out there.”

It’s 100% clear where the priorities of this party are, how they will blatantly put money, power and party well before the well being and future of the country or its citizens.

We’re talking about a president that lies on a daily basis, ignores basic intelligence, contradicts himself, has the need to feed and validate his huge ego, alienates and infuriates his closest allies, and lacks some of the basic intelligence you’d need to get a hight school degree.

How an entire party, government and part of a country can ignore so much incompetence and keep siding with him, believe every word that comes out of his mouth isn’t just baffling to America, but the world.

When does this end? What will it take for congress and republicans to realize that this man is not fit to be president?

Once the death has been made public, Holyrood Palace, St Giles' Cathedral, and the Scottish Parliament will serve as the focal point of  gatherings, with a condolence book open to the public set up at the  latter location. Parliamentary business will be suspended immediately for at least six parliamentary days, in order to allow authorities to  prepare for the funeral.

The parliament will then prepare a motion of condolence within 72 hours of reconvening. The Queen's coffin will first lie in repose at Holyrood Palace, followed by a service of reception at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. Following this, the coffin would then be transported to Waverley station and then taken by the Royal Train to London if possible.

Otherwise, the coffin would be taken by plane to London and welcomed by the prime minister and cabinet ministers.

"One thing I'll say: I think the United States is coming off looking really honest and transparent in all of this. Two days ago, I read that within Russia, US intelligence reports were being dismissed by the public as part of an American misinformation campaign.

I don't say any of this to chest-thump for the US, but to show how badly I think Putin has miscalculated. The approach the US took these past several weeks in publicly and frequently airing accurate intelligence has put Putin in a tough spot. There's no getting around the fact that he's been lying this whole time (to the world and to his own people), and that the US was telling the truth. 

There's a universe where Putin could have NOT invaded Ukraine and actually made Biden look like an alarmist fool. But he didn't do that, and now he's the one who is coming across as irrational.

My take on NATO’s strategy here. Putin’s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin’s logical madness. 

NATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. 

When toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. 

The issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. 

As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to “contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. 

With Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin’s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. 

The west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn’t know, and isn’t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.

dit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I’m just calling it like I see it.

"Russia's claim that the root cause of the conflict is Ukraine wanting to join NATO is ridiculous and has already been disproven. There was no aspiration for Ukraine to join NATO until Russia attacked Crime and from there NATO aspiration only increased with Russian hostility such as the war in Donbass, the shooting down of MH17, the hijacking of Ukrainian coast guard ships from their own waters, the charging of a Ukrainian airforce pilot shot down in Donbass in Moscow as a ""terrorist""

Additionally Finland just joined NATO and despite Russian threats to immediately invade or nuke Finland if they joined NATO we've only seen a reduction of Russian troops from the NATO - Russian border in Finland, not an increase

  
So this boils down to what it always has, Russia is lying about why it invaded, it is not about resources, security, terrorism, satanic cults, Ukrainian LGBTQ+ ""perverting Russian culture,"" it's about Putin wanting territory to cement his legacy as the man who expanded Russia.

"It is also worth pointing out that the pricetag for the military aid is inflated.

Remember, alot of these munitions and vehicles that are sent over are items that were planned to be phased out from USA armed service, replaced by newer and more modern arms and equipment.

So paying full price for something that USA was about to phase out and discard in the next few years seems abit dishonest request aswell.

Long story [short](https://web.archive.org/web/20190118115211/https://www.economist.com/business/2019/01/17/how-the-american-takeover-of-a-french-national-champion-became-intertwined-in-a-corruption-investigation): In the 2010s French company Alstom made some shady deals amounting to corruption practices, the US (Obama's) DOE leveraged this (to the point of taking [hostage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Pierucci)), threatening astronomical fines, to force the hand of the French Government to approve a buy out of Alstom by General Electric for figurative peanuts.    
The French Economy Minister at the time, who had to reluctantly sign off the deal, was a young ... Emanuel Macron.     
France [bureaucracy](https://www.ege.fr/infoguerre/les-pertes-de-souverainete-industrielle-cas-decole-la-francaise) sill has [PTSD](https://www.vie-publique.fr/rapport/38473-proteger-nos-entreprises-des-lois-et-mesures-portee-extraterritoriale) from the affaire.   


In other words, Trump is strongly hinting that he is willing to weaponize the DOE, under the guise of his anti-DEI ideology (to please his crowd), for America's (or rather his owns) interests.     
Seeing what Obama was already capable of, waiving the flag of anti-corruption (in the case of Alstom, not without some objective arguments), it's sobering to imagine what the Trump team can concoct and feel justified doing.   

Obviously in Trump USA one can demonstrate subservience, buy favors and avoid scrutiny in many different ways.

I am almost certain that this is the same wording which has been in place for the USA travel guidance for many years, and it doesn't represent any change in official travel advisory status for UK citizens entering the USA.

EDIT: per u/DisillusionedExLib there has been a change in wording in this paragraph which draws attention to the fact that enforcement of the rules around entry to the US is being enforced more aggressively, but that isn't the same as [an FCDO advice notice to avoid all but essential travel or to avoid all travel](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice).

 ""Ice detention isn't just a bureaucratic nightmare. It's a business.

These facilities are privately owned and run for profit.

Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group receive government funding based on the number of people they detain, which is why they lobby for stricter immigration policies. It's a lucrative business: CoreCivic made over $560m from Ice contracts in a single year. In 2024, GEO Group made more than $763m from Ice contracts.

The more detainees, the more money they make. It stands to reason that these companies have no incentive to release people quickly.

"Something about this doesn’t sit right with me.

He’s reaching out to countries I wouldn’t have expected, each of which holds more strategic weight than it seems at first glance.

One is home to an autonomous region he’s openly said he wants to annex. Another sits squarely in the path of where Putin’s ambitions have been inching. And the third? Right on Russia’s northern border, perfectly positioned for any hypothetical push toward St. Petersburg. If a wider conflict were to erupt, that territory would be crucial to secure immediately.

In fact, when you look at a map, you’ve got Finland, Lithuania, and Estonia, surrounding the Russian end of the Baltics, Denmark at its entrance. The inner perfectly placed for a drive toward St. Petersburg, and deeper into Russia beyond that. Is this about reclaiming “NATO lake”? Securing St Petersburg? Something else entirely?

Trump’s exactly the type to say “fuck it” and ignore the bird flu entirely if it meant driving prices down at home. Optics have always mattered more to him than outcomes. I just don’t buy the idea that he’d willingly go begging to Europe, it makes him, and by extension the US, look weak. He let hundreds of thousands die through sheer negligence during COVID. What’s a few more deaths if it means saving face? That’s pocket change to him.

I play a lot of chess, and this doesn’t feel like desperate scrambling for help. It feels like a closed position, quietly shifting pieces, waiting for the right moment to crack open the centre. Trump might be a clown, but the people behind him (except the South African immigrant welfare queen) aren’t inept, aren't restraining him this time around.
