"I'm normally opposed to getting involved in these types of protests but in the spirit of solidarity on this unique issue here is the letter I wrote on the matter to government individuals relative to me (sparing names because I'm loathe to give breadcrumbs to my identity on the internet) :

As we are on the cusp of a repeal of net neutrality I believe strongly that this is a turning point for Republican politics in the long term.  My steadfast loyalty to the Republic party has been resolute due to my steadfast believe in a party platform of personal ethics, responsibility and freedom.  However a steadfast faith in free market economics (in general) should not be confused with a belief in market anarchy.

The nature of internet neutrality is not hostile to the free market unless we are absolutely devoid of nuance in our appreciation of the market.  Even a fan favorite Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, understood that there are certain protections for the spirit of free enterprise that must guarantee a de facto fair trading place if we can expect the merits of a free market to rule.

Consumers do not have the power to choose a different supply if the majority of a primary resource is controlled by a de facto aristocracy like a fief who does not rely on the traditional rules we come to expect that allows clear winners and losers to emerge.  In smalltown Louisiana a simple matter of anti-business, anti-competitor practices carried out by super chains create an economic dependency where choice is robbed of the consumer, because a manipulation of resources guarantees that the success or failure of a local market is irrelevant, because national and international resources will be pumped into defeating competition until the consumer is left with only a single choice.

This Wal-Mart Effect is a dangerous possibility with the repeal of internet neutrality.  The internet in its earliest days was a luxury of those that could afford personal PCs, leisure time, and the chance to browse an emerging technology.  So much of our cultural, economic, and social strata is now definitively affected by our access to the internet.  Most of our president's decrees, in fact, are more accessible through the internet than traditional press means.

And with this murky territory that the internet exists in, somewhere between a service and a utility, the Republican Party, as the majority holders in Congress and the ""face"" of current domestic policy, are in effect telling the people of the United States that this borderline utility, even our very access to the President's preferred method of communication, should be arbitrated by private holding gatekeepers.  This amounts to, quite literally, the digital age's equivalence of emerging railroad barons, who guarantee access for the few that enrich the already industrious elite, on the back of infrastructure that is consistently already facilitated by public means.

The repeal of internet neutrality is a matter that will, indisputably, occur in the future.  Aristocratic style monopolies have never existed in perpetuity and the dangerous tycoon fostering that the FCC's proposed revocation will insure guarantees that in time this FCC repeal *will* be overturned.

However in that time the Republican Party will have suffered the irreparable damage of being the facilitators of this madness.  The historic damage will be done and after 8 years of the face of Democrats the Republicans, in their first year of power, will have tarnished their reputation so thoroughly that in future films casting directors will ask for Bella Lugosi look alikes to play the Republican leaders in biopics about this event.

If the Republican Party hopes to retain seats and my loyalty they must demonstrate that they believe in the principles of a fair market, not the creation of a nobility class that controls one of the most important means of communication and business in our time so that anti-capitalist exploits will keep us in a digital dark age.

I implore you to use anything within your power to block this attempt to repeal net neutrality in the spirit of Republican values.",2,2017-11-22T06:36:54,"Join the Battle for Net Neutrality!!

"I've been thinking about this whole thing, and actually I've decided I don't give a fuck about net neutrality getting repealed or not. American ISPs and cable companies are the cancer of America, we all know that, and shit has to change to make them better. On the other hand, I don't really care if they charge me for individual services. I'm already paying $150/month for 100up/down, and it crashes like 4x a day. It's not like they're gonna start charging $500/month suddenly. If they charge for extra shit, the price will remain about the same for me, maybe $200/month at worst and I don't care about that. I care that they haven't really updated their infrastructure since the 80s, most of America is not covered by fiber, and the companies are really fucking shitty and evil",2,2017-11-22T08:45:25,"Join the Battle for Net Neutrality!!

"It is good to see that the push-back against net neutrality abolishment is getting so much traction. I am not sure if there has ever been an initiative so unpopular with the public, many times rebuked, yet that is nonetheless pushed forward, again and again, by giant corporate buaurocracies and corrupt officials.


Many of the evils that killing off net neutrality would bring about have already been mentioned in many threads. The biggest one seems to be only glossed about though. In my view, the whole fight is primarily about the control of information flow. This is way bigger and way more important than, for example, charging fees for access, although that too is a part of the same game.


Control of information can take very insidious forms. The goal is to dismantle the internet as a free for all competition of ideas where corporate powers (ISPs and their affiliates) do not have an automatic, insurmountable advantage. The game is not rigged enough in their favour, which is why we are seeing repeated attempts to move the goal posts. 


Imagine a future internet where you are not able to create an accessible website or blog unless you sign an agreement that all content you put online will be reviewed by your ISP, and obviously confined to a list of pre-approved topics. If you want to stay afloat, you will be well advised to show proper ideological fervor by peppering your site with grassroots slogans such as: ""Comcast is great!"", ""Corporations are cuddly people"", or ""In ISP, we trust."". All with a smile on your face, lest you be thought as an enemy of the system.",2,2017-11-22T10:02:25,"Join the Battle for Net Neutrality!!

"I, for one, stopped caring.

I was a huge fan. I had the show on in the background 24/7. I had youtube vids playing on book theories. I had a mental log of all the mysteries in the books. I re-read the books several times. I had discussions about the show. I talked to strangers about it. I'd talk to friends about it. I'd find someone as into it as I am and talk for hours about it.

But now? The cracks were visible in season 5. By the end of season 8 the show turned into a pile of shit. A soulless nothing - a pop culture milestone perverted and betrayed. Everything was shit. And the worst part is they may have given away the ending to the books.

Dude took so long I legit do not care anymore. At all.

I dont care about any new shows because even if they are amazing they can turn to shit on a dime. I dont trust HBO with that universe anymore just as I dont trust anything D and D do to be worth spending money to watch.  I dont care about the books anymore because its been so long and its already had parts of it given away.

I still feel a personal dislike bordering on hatred for the show runners D and D, and I'm not sure I would even buy GRRM a pint at this point. The legacy of GoT is like a character from ASOIAF, great potential murdered by forces outside of its control before a goal realized.

"I think of GoT, CoK and SoS as the greatest fantasy trilogy of all time. Sure, you're left with a lot of unknowns, but there is a good amount of closure for the main characters at that point--Jon defeated the wildlings, denies Stanis' offer to be declared Stark and becomes Lord Commander. Tyrion kills his father avenging Tysha and Dany decides to learn to rule rather than just conquer and pillage. Those three books are tight, cohesive and we'll edited. The next two books while having good content are anything but cohesive. It's not just the timeline jumps, it's that POVs and storylines that seemingly have no purpose, some chapters are ridiculously long, etc. Whatever magic GRRM had in the 90s he has yet to be able to recapture.

"It's really amazing to think about just how far George has fallen in public perception

Those first three books are in the all time inner pantheon of best fantasy novels of all time. That was a hall of fame resume right there

And then George hit a wall for whatever reason (too much gardening and not enough having any idea where he was going is my personal theory) and everything since then has felt like the marriage that goes on too long. Too many broken promises. You try, but things feel forced. You can already see how it's going to end and it's not good, but you have this irrational hope that things could be the way they used to be.

And the show just made it worse because it stole away the tension of ""what will happen?"" And delay and the awful drawn out boredom of books 4 and 5 killed our memory of how good it felt to read those first three books because that was like 20 years ago. 

Not like this is the first time an epic fantasy has lost its way and probably never will be finished.

2. This is not censorship. Nobody's rights are being infringed upon. The author of the removed material is still legally allowed to sell it elsewhere.
3. Other books full of bad science certainly exist, and many of them are for sale on Amazon. That fact does not constitute an endorsement by the company of their contents. It's possible that they could be removed in the future.

"Such a bullshit rule. I volunteer in a prison in London (visitor centre to be precise). We can take up to 5 books for prisoners from visitors. This is each time and each visitor. I believe prisoners can also purchase their own books from specific shops online. If we take books at the desk, it takes about 2 weeks to get to them. What I do is basically flick through the books to check nothing is in there (no notes etc.), record the details in a book, put it in a see through bag, attach a yellow label etc etc. I also make the visitor fill out a handing in books form. It is basically the first step. However, the  books get checked again inside the prison before they reach the prisoner. There is enough security.  I don't think this is even about security though and it makes no sense. How is making it harder to read for prisoners going to result in better outcomes and rehabilitation? It is simply not. The way I see it, they just want to make them suffer and that is all. The benefits of reading for everyone -incarcerated or not - are countless. However, for someone who has lost their liberty, it is even more important to have access to books.

"The sex scene is VERY important to the overall **theme** of the book. Most people are so busy running a train on the plot that they completely ignore the story's luxurious thread count and how the soft lighting bounces perfectly off its ass.


The book's theme is ""it."" The ""it"" that children aren't supposed to know about and that adults don't want to think about.
> Did you hear that Bobby and Susy are doing *it*?

> My dad hasn't been back from getting smokes and *it's* not something my mom wants to talk about

> I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT *IT*

> *It* isn't something I want to talk about right now

This is even why the children name the creature as ""IT"" and continue to address it as such while adults. They don't know wtf *IT* really is and they really don't want to remember or talk about **it**. The creature is the personification of *it*; the deadlights are the spacial representation of *it*.


At the end, in the '58 sewers, they hadn't truly beaten IT but Beverly knew they had to somehow beat **it** to continue. They couldn't just sit around and talk about sex, they knew nothing about sex, the entire concept was still *it*. The creature's power was over those who accepted ""*it*"" as a societal norm. They beat IT and then they had to beat *it*. And for people who say Bev got used, fuck you, Bev beat the shit out of **it** (practically by herself) twice in one night.


As adults they first had to beat *it* in their homes and minds before they could leave to beat IT. Stan just couldn't get it up the second time around.",2748,2017-09-10T05:08:08,"Stephen King briefly talks about the controversial orgy scene in the 'IT' novel.

"My theory on the wildly divergent American views on sex and violence has been that it's because violence is something that often happens in public, while sex is something that almost always happens in private.

Basically, it's a rule based on our own preference to have sex in private.  It's the norm, and so because it is out of sight, that becomes the rule.

Likewise, if it was normal that people would always make fights extremely private, almost always between 2 people, ad in a private tucked-away room, then I think we'd see a similar hesitance to show violence.

"Here's the full quote. 

>*I wasn‚Äôt really thinking of the sexual aspect of it. The book dealt with childhood and adulthood ‚Äì1958 and Grown Ups. The grown ups don‚Äôt remember their childhood. None of us remember what we did as children‚Äìwe think we do, but we don‚Äôt remember it as it really happened. Intuitively, the Losers knew they had to be together again. The sexual act connected childhood and adulthood. It‚Äôs another version of the glass tunnel that connects the children‚Äôs library and the adult library. Times have changed since I wrote that scene and there is now more sensitivity to those issues.* 

My take on it. 

>I wasn‚Äôt really thinking of the sexual aspect of it.

I don't even know what to say here. I totally get the artistic reasoning for doing things (not this though) and the like but I don't see how you could write a gang bang of kids and just think nothing of the sex. 

>The sexual act connected childhood and adulthood.

They could have done something else to signify that. Ben could have brought a cigar or a nip of whisky and they all had a go at that. Their dialogue afterwards and perspectives written afterwards could have shown the connection. 

>. Times have changed since I wrote that scene and there is now more sensitivity to those issues.

Uh King as much as I love you. 99% of the population never has been for child gang bangs. 

It's a horror book about child murder, so the murder is expected, kid gang bangs not so much. The part that makes the book scary isn't the clown per se it's the fact that kids are being killed; no one wants to float. So his comment about ""only paying attention to the gang bang"" is odd. It's like dude if someone served you a dinner of steak, potato and then put a scoop of shit on your steak. You're not going to talk about how your upset that the shit was on the steak. You're going to make mention of the fact that you were served shit to begin with.

As the boys start to panic, Beverly comes up with the idea of having sex with the others in order to calm them down, as a result the other Losers take turns having sex with her. Because King didn't wish this to be viewed as a lewd scene, the narrative explicitly states that the act of intimacy with each of the boys' helps to further strengthen their friendship; and Beverly only experiences orgasm while having intercourse with Bill Denbrough and Ben Hanscom.

"While the chapter is definitely jarring and comes out of left field for the reader, the surrealness of the world those kids lived in at the time and the importance of their connection to one another made the scene make a kind of bizarre sense. Numerous times in the book it's mentioned that their power comes from their connection to one another, the death of one of their members is enough to weaken them significantly. Their status as misfits is one shared. In It's world, these symbolic connections are given power by the belief of the kids, much like It's strength is empowered by their belief beget by fear. Something like sex for the first time, already occupying a weird and almost sacred space in any kid's psyche, has enough symbolic power tying them all together that it would empower them in such an other-worldly encounter. It's weird and certainly not recommended for a real situation but these factors make it make sense when they sought to protect themselves before their showdown with It.

"It goes something like this:

Every single human being on this planet has experienced issues regarding sexuality. We have all at one time or another been embarrassed by our inexperience or ashamed by our self-perceptions (penis size, breast size, sexual performance). We have all been taught conflicting ideas about sexuality through the various media/religion/societal pressures around us. We have all found ourselves being aroused by, or detecting a sexual experience we either witness from afar or feel first-hand. 

Meanwhile, barely any of us have experienced murder. Only a few of us commit or witness a murder so that our connection to the killing of another human being is MUCH more abstract when you compare it to the feelings we associate with all things sexual. 

There's a reason why a scene of a man taking a swig of alcohol means more to a recovering alcoholic, or the scene of a rape scene means more to someone who has experienced such abuse. You will find the most emotional reaction from a person when they have a personal stake in the subject being portrayed. It is easy to become desensitized by violence because most of us do not experience it in the ways that we see on television. However, you can bet that there are plenty of people that are ashamed enough of their arousal from a gangbang that they will morph it into a knee-jerk reaction of fear and disgust.

I'm sure that there are plenty of other factors that go into this, in my opinion, the most important one is that sexuality is much more real to the average person than murder.",27,2017-09-10T05:47:05,"Stephen King briefly talks about the controversial orgy scene in the 'IT' novel.

"The arc for season 3 of the BBC show Torchwood (the 2006 adult spinoff of Doctor Who) ends with the UK having to sacrifice 10% of it's children to an alien menace so they won't kill everyone.

So the government decided to euthanize the children starting from the bottom of the school league tables.

> So: set against that, you got the failing schools, full of the less able, the less socially useful, those destined to spend a lifetime on benefits occupying places on the dole queue and, frankly, the prisons.

"Due to covid, all exams for 16 and 18 year olds were cancelled in the UK. These are the big ones, GCSEs and A levels respectively. the A levels particularly determine whether you get into the first or second college or university of your choice. 

Due to the cancellation of exams, teachers were asked to provide an expected grade for each person based on their work over the previous 2 years and their mock exam results. 

Instead of awarding these grades, the government then directed the exam boards to run these predicted grades through an algorithm that took into account the previous results from that particular school. 

The result? The majority of students from schools in poorer areas received results (in some cases 3 grades) lower than predicted, while richer areas had their results raised. 

While it wasn't meant to do this in concept, it was meant to ensure teachers were not unfairly generous, unfortunately it generally happens that schools in poor areas do worse. (Socioeconomic deprivation etc). Therefore, those schools were hit very harshly by the algorithm.

The students worse hit were the exceptional outliers in these poor schools. Brilliant students who had worked their way through their tough circumstances only to have their As turned to Cs and Ds. 

Think back to those times, you work your butt off for 12 years only to have it ripped away by an algorithm because you live somewhere poor.

">An 18-year-old student who predicted this year‚Äôs A-level results crisis in an award-winning dystopian story about an algorithm deciding school grades according to social class, has had her own results downgraded.

>‚ÄúI‚Äôve fallen into my story. It‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù said Jessica Johnson, a student at Ashton Sixth Form College in Greater Manchester. ‚ÄúI based it on the educational inequality I already saw. I just exaggerated that inequality and added the algorithm. But I really didn‚Äôt think it would come true as quick as it did!‚Äù

>Johnson won an Orwell youth prize senior award in 2019 for her short story titled A Band Apart, which was the first one she had written. Set in 2029, it imagined a system where students were sorted into bands based on their background. ‚ÄúMum still thinks I can be a doctor. She doesn‚Äôt understand how hard it is to get into Band 1 for people like us,‚Äù says a character in the story.

>Johnson had her English A-level result downgraded from A to B and lost her place at the University of St Andrews before the government‚Äôs U-turn on Monday. Now that results will be based on teacher assessments instead, she is hopeful that her place will be restored.

>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been so stressed and anxious these past few days, waiting to hear back from universities,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe got told you can go wherever you want in life if you work hard enough, but we‚Äôve seen this year that no matter how hard you worked, you got given a grade based on where you live.‚Äù

>Prof Jean Seaton, director of the Orwell prize, said: ‚ÄúJessica saw into the heart of what the system represents and her story demonstrates the human ability which exams only exist to uncover.‚Äù

"For those unaware, the first system the UK government used was based on school performance and teacher assessments. As a result, students in worse performing schools that were on for As might have been downgraded to Bs or Cs, whereas those at better performing schools might have had the reverse happen.

Of course school performance is linked heavily to how rich the area is, and as a result it was seen (Not unjustly) as a new form of class warfare. On top of that there were a few cases where students were discouraged from contesting their results, such as an education ombudsman telling students that if they do it and get bumped up a grade, they're causing someone else to drop a grade.

In all it was a major fuckup, the government tried shifting the blame onto students/schools, and after a *lot* of people got pissed off the government backtracked.",35,2020-08-21T22:19:44,In 2018 Jessica Johnson wrote an Orwell prize-winning short story about an algorithm that decides school grades according to social class.

"This isn't new. In 7th grade they started separating us into groups A B C D and E. A and B were all the rich kids. The other three groups were not rich. When we asked them how they separated they said by grade level. I told them I had a 98 in math. Did everyone in A and B have 99s and 100s? Teacher looked at me straight in the face and said yes.  

Fast forward a year to 8th grade, A and B group took pre algebra while the rest of us took more remedial math type of course. We all had mixed group home room, so during home room, two of the A group asked me for help with pre algebra. I never saw it but I'd read the couple pages then read the examples they wrote down then would show them. At the end of the year, the math teacher had to sign off on what math we went into. If you done pre algebra she'd sign you up for algebra and you'd be able to complete college course math in high school. If not, you were put into another remedial math, then 10th grade pre algebra (you read that right), then 11th algebra 1, 12th algebra 2.  

I went up to the teacher at the end to get my paper signed for what class she was going to put me in. She looked at me and looked kinda troubled then even though I saw her use the top stamp on everyone in my group C (for remedial math in high school) she looked at me and asked, ""I feel like I've seen your handwriting alot this semester. Do you know what I mean?"" I'd do an example or two while teaching two A group students and they never erased. I hesitated and said, ""yeah"" and she frowned and looked down and stamped me in for algebra 1 saying ""I believe you can do it."" which put me on a college pathway I may not have otherwise pursued.  

Sorting by class just showed me that those who have, will keep, and those who don't, will struggle.

"Not sure I like this. The kids don't care about the 2 dollar discount, so it ends up being an incentive for parents to *make* their kids read. I feel like many kids will be forced to read by their parents, and they get nothing in return, making them dislike reading. I feel like a lollipop or toy worth 2 dollars would be way better if you want kids to actually read and keep liking it. 

EDIT:  as /u/TheQueg and /u/punfull point out, the end of the article strongly implies that the barber gives the 2 dollars directly to the kid, instead of giving a 2 dollar discount. While there'll still be parents who take back the 2 dollars from their kids, I guess they'd be a minority. If it's actually like that, I definitely *do* like it, because the kid gets an actual tangible reward themselves, and gets a positive reward for reading, while the parents aren't that strongly incentivized to force their kids to read. After all, it's the kids' choice of whether they want the two bucks or not.

In the same book there was another boy turned into a mouse, Bruno, but his story is potentially more tragic. He was returned to his parents by story‚Äôs end, and they are understandably shocked and appalled that their child has become a mouse. Luke and his grandma later discuss what might become of Bruno, and they just casually bring up the possibility that his parents might drown him in a bucket filled with water because they can‚Äôt handle his transformation. They don‚Äôt even dwell on it that long, they just move on in the conversation.",1549,2025-04-19T11:31:50,Roald Dahl's 'The Witches' is a fantastic depiction of a child with a short life expectancy,books,dahl definitely knack make child story dark keep bound whimsy child capable maintain book boy turn mouse bruno story potentially tragic return parent story end understandably shock appalled child mouse luke grandma later discuss bruno casually bring possibility parent drown bucket fill water handle transformation dwell long conversation,dahl definitely knack make child story dark keep bound whimsy child capable maintain book boy turn mouse bruno story potentially tragic return parent story end understandably shock appalled child mouse luke grandma later discuss bruno casually bring possibility parent drown bucket fill water handle transformation dwell long conversation
"The witches was one of my favorite RD books growing up, and I recall loving that he stayed a mouse; it felt like the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù was extended and the illustrations made my 6-7 year old brain connect more with a cartoon mouse than a little boy (I‚Äôm a girl). 

The ending never bothered me at all. If anything I liked it because it was bittersweet, it made the witches scarier.  It was the first book I remember reading that had such an ending and I was happy for the little boy that he would pass with his beloved grandmother. I think children are smarter than adults give them credit for; I knew at that age that some children died young. 

If you‚Äôre a child old enough to read the witches, you likely know death is a major part of the world. The witches is, frankly, a dark book. Remember at the beginning when the grandmother is telling the boy about other children who disappeared because of witches? I remember LOVING that part because oh my god how fascinating. How scary. It felt like a ‚Äúserious‚Äù story and I loved it.

Overall yes I remember loving this entire book as a child and the movie ending cheapens it. Let these witches stay terrifying. Let kids get excited and scared.

"A few years ago a friend of mine passed away at the age of 28. No one would say anything about the cause of death, and I initially assumed it was suicide. But at his funeral I met his parents and learned that he had a congenital heart condition and hadn't even been expected to make it to 20. By living to 28 he had, in fact, surpassed everyone's expectations. I also learned that he had intentionally refrained from telling anyone other than his closest friends that he was going to die relatively soon because he didn't want anyone to treat him differently because of it.

Reflecting on our relationship after that I realized that a lot of what had a attracted me to him in the first place was the fact that he was really only concerned with doing good where he could and having fun where he could and making the most of whatever time he had. He lived the amount of life he had to its absolute fullest and touched the lives of everyone he encountered.

All this is to say, as depressing as it is to think about, I think you're right that children who probably won't have a full lifespan do absolutely deserve to know that at some point so they can live their best lives, and to be told that just because a life is shorter doesn't make it any less important.",127,2025-04-19T14:53:58,Roald Dahl's 'The Witches' is a fantastic depiction of a child with a short life expectancy,books,year ago friend pass away age cause death initially assume suicide funeral meet parent learn congenital heart condition expect living fact surpass expectation learned intentionally refrain tell close friend going die relatively soon want treat differently reflect relationship realize lot attract place fact concerned good have fun make time live life absolute full touch life encounter depressing think think right child probably lifespan absolutely deserve know point live good life tell life shorter important,"year ago friend pass away age cause death initially assume suicide funeral meet parent learn congenital heart condition expect living fact surpass expectation learned intentionally refrain tell close friend going die relatively soon want treat differently

"How about this take?

As adults, we might be horrified by this idea- ESPECIALLY parents.  Remember, no parent (at least, loving parents) want to bury their own child.  And his transformation as well as shortened life- yeah, that's something no parent generally even wants to THINK about (I saw other ways that this could be taken, and remember that at the end of the day, so much of human society is based on appearance)

But we read the book as children?  Yeah, you might find it a bit sad.  But to me, it also shows that children often have a lack of empathy- remember, it's children who are the most notorious for the age-old idea of burning insects like ants.  It's also why so many children get called a variety of names by adults- kids might do dumb things (a whole subreddit is dedicated to this), but they can also be very,very cruel as well.

Roald Dahl is infamous for the darkness within his childrens' stories... but maybe he also understood that children also have the ability to go, ""Oof, that wasn't nice.  Anyways..."", which is something that gets heavily frowned upon as adults.",7,2025-04-20T06:07:27,Roald Dahl's 'The Witches' is a fantastic depiction of a child with a short life expectancy,books,adult horrify idea especially parent remember parent love parent want bury child transformation shorten life yeah parent generally want think see way take remember end day human society base appearance read book child yeah find bit sad show child lack empathy remember child notorious age old idea burn insect like ant child call variety name adult kid dumb thing subreddit dedicated cruel road dahl infamous darkness child story maybe understand child ability oof nice anyways get heavily frown adult,"

"Ronald Dahl's daughter died at 7 of measles. It absolutely devastated him.  Childhood death was much more common then. That shows in literature from that time and I think it clearly influenced his writing, as did his own childhood, which was filled with loss and abundance and weird British public school discipline and rituals.


Ronald Dahl also had something few authors have: the ability to write how it *feels* to be a kid. I think that is why his books are so beloved by kids and adults. He doesn't sugarcoat things, nor does he make it all darkness. His stories have bullies and conformists and clever kids and regular kids and wonderful adults and hateful adults.  There are giants, magical grains of rice, witches, talking mice, enchanted fruit, huge insects, rivers of chocolate, experimental candy, and so many other unexpected things. Like some musicians have a sound, he has a very unique style. There's nobody like him.

"Your comment about censorship or modification of books to better suit modern sensibilities resonates with me (I think the books should stay the same and if they want to do modern versions it should be over the top obvious that it is a modern rewrite/retelling - I think it‚Äôs fine to generate interest in an older story with a modernized version as long as there‚Äôs no confusion that it‚Äôs NOT the original). 

But it reminds me of my husband reading The Little Red Hen to our daughter. He called it ‚Äúthe passive aggressive little red hen‚Äù and red it in a voice that made the little red hen sound like such an a-hole. lol. And truly the original is ridiculous.

We even had people sitting on the floor by our tills who started reading as soon as they'd paid for it and stayed there for hours.

"Probably not. People are a lot less content starved now than in 1998. I had a computer connected to the internet back then, but it took 8 minutes to download a .JPG of a pikachu so for the purposes of our discussion the modern internet didn't exist.

Back around the turn of the millenium, there were about 25,000 ""fiction"" books a year published in the english language. 25k sounds like a lot at a glance, but assuming an author publishes every other year that's supporting at most 50k writers from a then US/UK population of 340 million.

These books almost exclusively went through the traditional publishing pipeline. Authors would pitch their manuscript to the publisher like a screenwriter does to Hollywood execs, and the decision process was very similar, throwing around business terms like ""marketability"", ""formula"", ""target demographics"" and ""formulas"".

Today, there are about 200,000 fictions ""published"" per year in english. It's fashionable on Reddit to shit on Amazon because their founder is a Billionaire, but his company, which started as an online bookstore, revolutionized the publishing industry. Amazon makes their entire suite of high-quality digital publishing tools freely available to the public. Anyone can self-publish their manuscript to the Kindle platform under better terms than the traditional publishers gave any but the most popular writers.

As the story goes JK Rowling famously assembled her manuscript while working waitstaff at a cafe. Writing on literal napkins during her downtime bored at work (remember this was before cellphones). Her lucky break came when a publisher decided to take a risk on something different, a story about a mundane kid who goes to wizarding school.


JK Rowling born twenty years later would probably post her hobby work to RoyalRoad or equivalent a chapter at a time.

She would grow a modest following as she built writing skills and open a Patreon. Ad-based users reading for free, with Patrons reading a couple chapters ahead.

The Patreon money would accumulate to a point where she takes the leap to quit her day job and write full time.

The quality would continue to improve and she would build momentum. At a certain point, she would finish a novel sized section. Then begin the process of editing, revising, and re-writing earlier sections with a much more experienced eye. Eventually it would get digitally published to kindle/e-readers/ect, either alone or with the help of Author-owned independent ""publishers"" who fill the role of reviewers. Successful digital authors often do print runs eventually.

In this parallel world, Harry potter probably doesn't reach the same level of Buzz, but that's because this new business model is supporting literally 10x the full-time authors competing on digital store shelves. She still probably gets fabulously wealthy.",8,2025-04-23T14:58:08,Do you still remember the hype back then when new Harry Potter books were released?

It‚Äôs like asking if there will ever be another thing like Beatlemania.

There will be other hit books but there will not be another ‚ÄòHarry Potter‚Äô event. That was a combination of perfect audience, perfect timing, physical media still dominating, a successful film series and (at the time) an author with a very charismatic origin story.

"You never know. Sometimes things hit randomly and there‚Äôs no rhyme or reason. The MCU is a big example of it most recently where every film was more successful than the last.

Release a third, there‚Äôs a bit of hype, pre-orders are high, a fanbase grows.

 I was ten when the first book came out, and saw it go from ‚Äúsomething librarians quietly recommend for children‚Äù (which is how I found it) to ‚Äúsomething the adults in my life also knew about and wanted to read‚Äù. I remember the transition from ‚Äúoh hey, there‚Äôs a new book‚Äù for the second and third, to ‚ÄúMASSIVE RELEASE PARTY OMG‚Äú for the fourth. I remember when new editions were released with deliberately understated covers so adults could read them on the train or something without feeling weird - absolutely nothing changed about the text, it was just the cover, but there was a market for this slightly more grown up version.

The hype was not a constant thing at the time. It happened in stages.

With that in mind, yes, I think it could happen again. Particularly given how much more acceptable it is now for definitely-adults to delve into (or never quite leave) kids or YA fiction, and how many teenagers (particularly teenage girls) are diving headfirst into fairy porn and romantasy that‚Äôs strictly speaking meant for adults but still appeals very much to them as well‚Ä¶some of the boundaries between ‚Äúbooks meant for grown ups‚Äù  and ‚Äúbooks meant for kids or teens‚Äù are shifting.

"Honestly: no.

As much as I loathe what JKR has become, the period where the HP books were a MASSIVE CULTURAL EVENT was a joy to live through. I was in London at the time, and it was *incredibly* fun. The queues, the media stories... and, above all, that weird sense of community that came from seeing lots of strangers all reading the same book. You'd go to any coffee shop, cafe - even on the tube - and it was a really joyously *communal* experience.

Pretty much every cultural and contextual factor that made that possible has now changed. We're much more fragmented in the way we discover and consume media. There are many, many more options. And there's also much more algorithmic cultural 'railroading'. People have a much larger variety *and* the media environment encourages us to stay in our lane. There are fewer cultural properties of any sort that are 'universal' to the extent that HP was at its time. 

It is also worth noting that the retail landscape has also changed immensely. *Goblet of Fire* was 2000! Books came from bookshops and supermarkets. People queued outside of places like Tesco and Sainsburys. That made a huge part of the communal experience: you could visibly see how popular something was, and also be there with other people. Now, the vast majority of book purchases take place online, and via Amazon. You can have a book that outsells Harry Potter (hi, *Onyx Flame*), but never actually *see* anyone buy it. 

(Amazon UK had $40m in net sales in the first quarter of 2000. UK net sales in the first quarter of 2024 were close to *$10 billion.* Those are from their statements, with a bit of dodgy currency conversion on my part, so please check the math.)",41,2025-04-23T09:10:35,Do you still remember the hype back then when new Harry Potter books were released?

Now, if anything, it‚Äôs harder to get kids into books. People were already bemoaning how kids would rather watch tv or play video games than read back in 97/98 when the books started to come out. Smart phones have only intensified that.

Secondly, even back then, the Harry Potter hype wasn‚Äôt normal. No other book series had ever, or has since, become that kind of cultural juggernaut.

I think feeling empathy for Holden comes with age. He‚Äôs just a kid at the end of the day,619,2025-04-17T20:56:14,About the hatred for Holden Caulfield...,books,think feel empathy holden come age kid end day,think feel empathy holden come age kid end day
"I also read this book as an adult and couldn‚Äôt really understand the hate, or the way it was taught to teenagers.  Most high school curriculums focus on Holden‚Äôs little brother, and the idea that Holden doesn‚Äôt want to grow up.  It read to me not like a story about Peter Pan syndrome, but an an expose about sexual abuse in upper class boarding school circles.  

It opens with his terrible prep school roommate making plans to rape a girl from another school Holden is friends with. We find out Holden left or was kicked out of his previous school because he witnessed the death of a friend, who either jumped or was pushed out of a window by a group of boys who routinely beat up/sexually assaulted their classmates and were never punished for it.  After realizing he can‚Äôt win in a fight with the rapist roommate, Holden leaves to Manhattan, and walks around projecting onto and resenting all of the people who, like the school administrators who covered up his friend‚Äôs death via murder or suicide, are pretending everything is OK when it‚Äôs not, ie ‚Äúphonies.‚Äù

He meets up with a female friend, who opens up to him about being scared of her creepy stepfather who is constantly hanging around the house naked when she‚Äôs there.  One of his old teachers sees him at a bar, takes him home to offer him a safe place to sleep, and then gets sexually aggressive with him instead. The only adult who enforces sexual boundaries with Holden is a sex worker he harasses and lashes out at, who correctly identifies him as a kid and tells him to go home. Throughout all of this, he keeps having flashbacks to finding his dead friend‚Äôs body, and intrusive thoughts about killing himself in the same way, jumping from a tall building, because he sees life as an unending string of abuse and suffering that ‚Äúphony‚Äù adults either enable or perpetrate.  

The title, the Catcher in the Rye, is about Holden finally turning the intrusive thoughts about his friend‚Äôs jumping suicide into a constructive fantasy of being the ‚Äúcatcher‚Äù who saves him, who stands at the edge of a cliff and prevents other kids from jumping off.  It‚Äôs still wild to me that people think it‚Äôs about him being a proto serial killer??? 

I think it‚Äôs clear in retrospect that society was not ready to talk about the endemic abuse in elite private schools that this book was talking about, but it‚Äôs still crazy to me that it‚Äôs become such a meme of a spoiled, hateable character.",165,2025-04-17T21:58:02,About the hatred for Holden Caulfield...,books,"read book adult understand hate way teach teenager high school curriculum focus holden little brother idea holden want grow read like story peter pan syndrome expose sexual abuse upper class boarding school circle

"A lot of people view him as privileged and of money, so he will never be as sympathetic as a character that was poor that went through similar trials and tribulations. I don't agree with this take, but it's just something I've seen in critiques of the novel. Readers call him a spoiled rich kid.

Despite his privileged background, he actually goes through a lot! Death of a brother at a younger age, witnessing a suicide, and he alludes to sexual abuse in his past. 

On top of this he has some sort of undiagnosed mental health condition, possibly bipolar disorder, or simply an acute psychotic episode.

The catcher in the rye is one of my favorite books of all time. I understand why people hate Holden because he is a whiny annoying kid but honestly he's so relatable as a teenager. I was a depressed kid in high school with not so great parents and I had never felt so seen. I think I love the book because I read it as a teen - as an adult I'd be like god this kid is so annoying but as a teen I'm like yeah he's kind of annoying but also SO REAL. I need to read it again because it's been a while but I loved it. It's one of the only books that was required at school that I actually read.,17,2025-04-17T21:19:44,About the hatred for Holden Caulfield...,books,catcher rye favourite book time understand people hate holden whiny annoying kid honestly relatable teenager depressed kid high school great parent felt see think love book read teen adult cd like god kid annoying teen pm like yeah kind annoying real need read love book require school actually read,catcher rye favorite book time understand people hate holden whiny annoying kid honestly relatable teenager depressed kid high school great parent felt see think love book read teen adult like god kid annoying teen like yeah kind annoying real need read love book require school actually read

"I agree with those who have said age plays into it, but I think it has more to do with maturity as a reader. I get the impression a lot of people, especially younger readers, think you're supposed to like or relate to the protagonist. If you read the book with that lens, Holden is annoying to a lot of people. I also think some people relate a lot to Holden at a certain age (it might even be younger - my most emo phase was when I was 12 or 13), but if you read it when you're too old to relate to Holden but aren't at a point where you don't need to like or relate to protagonists, it doesn't work for a lot of people, and I think a lot of people read it in that time frame. Instead, if you can see it as a character study or interesting portrayal of this character, you have a lot less reason to dislike Holden. It reminds me of Lolita in that way - obviously I don't like or relate to its protagonist in any way, but it's an extraordinary piece of writing. I imagine the people who complain about Holden Caulfield overlap with the people who think Lolita is any form pro-pedophilia, because even now a lot of people have a hard time grasping that you don't have to like or relate to the protagonist. So I think that's a factor as well.",3,2025-04-17T23:35:42,About the hatred for Holden Caulfield...,books,agree say age play think maturity reader impression lot people especially young reader think suppose like relate protagonist read book lens holden annoying lot people think people relate lot holden certain age young emo phase read old relate holden point need like relate protagonist work lot people think lot people read time frame instead character study interesting portrayal character lot reason dislike holden remind lolita way obviously like relate protagonist way extraordinary piece write imagine people complain holden canfield overlap people think lolita form pro paedophilia lot people hard time grasp like relate protagonist think factor,agree say age play think maturity reader impression lot people especially young reader think suppose like relate protagonist read book lens holden annoying lot people think people relate lot holden certain age young emo phase read old relate holden point need like relate protagonist work lot people think lot people read time frame instead character study interesting portrayal character lot reason dislike holden remind lolita way obviously like relate protagonist way extraordinary piece write imagine people complain holden caulfield overlap people think lolita form pro pedophilia lot people hard time grasp like relate protagonist think factor

"I think hating on Catcher in the Rye is sort of a mid-20s trope. People want to be 'real grownups' in the 'real world' so they attack a teen character for acting immature instead of recognising that he's immature because he's a teen.

I also sort of feel like some people can't understand that teens who withdraw and become loners can be rude about their peers as a defense mechanism, to protect themselves from feeling the pain of rejection. I've definitely also seen a lot of weird takes about how bullied kids 'deserve it' for not working harder to fit in, and I think especially a reader in their mid-20s who was a bit of a bully in school might find it psychologically more comfortable to blame him entirely for his isolation instead of untangling all the situational stuff that brought him to where he is in the book.

"I don't know how true this rings for others, but I have often found *Catcher in the Rye* to be a good gauge for patience and empathy (and reading comprehension skills).

I hated being 15 and having my teacher tell me how much I was supposed to find Holden relatable and validating. Someone with his mentality was making my life hell and nobody could see it.

"I agree. I expressed a similar sentiment in a post a while ago.

I do think people whose sole takeaway is that Holden is an annoying character have done quite a shallow reading. While he is certainly annoying and a hypocrite, he doesn't develop in a vacuum (unless you count boarding schools as a kind of vacuum). He absorbs something from the bitter, jaded people that he encounters, reflects them, even. After all, he's at the age where these impressions stick and shape one's outlook.

Crucially, he's a kid overshadowed by the grief of a bereavement and the trauma of abuse (I read the scene with his teacher waking him up stroking his hair as indicative of some kind of abuse). With this context, we deeply empathise with his need for genuine connection and guidance and can look more kindly upon his abrasive qualities and broader disillusionment with other people.

At the end of the day, he's a kid who has been through a lot of shit. For me, the moments where the better angels of his nature shine through are more revealing than a bit of hypocrisy or the odd gauche remark. Choosing to be kind when one knows the cruelty of the world is the true revelation of one's character.

AFTER-THOUGHT: I think focussing on his wealth, whilst interesting, somewhat undermines Salinger's aim. I think he is trying to speak to the universal experience of growing up. That search for certainty in an increasingly uncertain world, the sense of anger and betrayal when you find out the values you were taught to cherish are conspicuously absent from the world and that it isn't as friendly a place you once thought it was. These experiences happen to everyone, regardless of your material circumstances. I think his material situation does a lot to help the plot sail more smoothly but I've not considered it within the context of his overall character.",4,2025-04-17T21:53:33,About the hatred for Holden Caulfield...,books,agree express similar sentiment post ago think people sole takeaway holden annoying character shallow reading certainly annoying hypocrite develop vacuum count boarding school kind vacuum absorb bitter jade people encounter reflect age impression stick shape outlook crucially kid overshadow grief bereavement trauma abuse read scene teacher wake stroke hair indicative kind abuse context deeply empathise need genuine connection guidance look kindly abrasive quality broader disillusionment people end day kid lot shit moment well angel nature shine reveal bit hypocrisy odd gauche remark choose kind know cruelty world true revelation character think think focusse wealth whilst interesting somewhat undermine salinger aim think try speak universal experience grow search certainty increasingly uncertain world sense anger betrayal find value teach cherish conspicuously absent world friendly place think experience happen regardless material circumstance think material situation lot help plot sail smoothly ave consider context overall character,"agree express similar sentiment post ago

"There are plenty of people in this real broad world and in literature who experience abuse and ARE NOT boring, whiney, stupid little bitches.

The two do not correlate.

As a character, you can be a whiney little bitch. You can be stupid. You can be immature. But if you are all these and boring, why would I enjoy reading about you?

Literature is full of flawed protagonists. Some are interesting to read, others not.

To me Holden belongs to the ""not interesting and irritating"" group. I hate the way he thinks, the way he talks, the way he behaves (his decision making is below average at best). I hate his immaturity. I was a teenager and I had teenager friends when I was young. None I remember was like that. What cave did Salinger live in? Has he seen any actual kids/teens?

And I found the book boring, too. There is a kid. Runs away from school. Wanders around aimlessly, doing stupid things. Why enjoy that?

I think this book either resonates with some experience or sentiment you have, or it doesn't.

I could not empathise with him. He has 0 emotional maturity, and is ignorant and na√Øve.

I also read it when I was in my late teens or early tweens. If I was 11 or 12 when I read it, it may have made things different. I think I would have been closer to his emotional maturity level and that may have worked. You know, when you feel very adult to yourself?

Finally, as in my country this book is not mandatory at school, a lot of people pick it up after someone's recommendation. That someone often being teacher (my case) or some wise adult who do not always realise world has changed and that people read different books. What you end up with is a disappointing protagonist, boring story and dated world. It's not fifties any more. Teens have different issues and deal with them differently these days, even if they do stupid things.

So to me, there was also ""not what I expected"" factor. Not deceived but more like what the heck, why did you recommend this.

And you don't learn anything from it.

I liked ""Trainspotting"" and ""Ham on Rye"" so much more, for instance. The protagonists are horribly flawed in these but I could empathise with them.

I don't know if this is a correlate/predictor, but I hate ""On the Road"" too. Stupid, good for nothing characters and absolutely pointless story.

Since I read both n-teen years ago, at this point in my life I might read them differently. But I still harbour sentiment ""never again"".

"One of my favourite books of all time ! Umberto Eco is my favourite writer, no doubt.

"Good review. Although I haven't reread it in quite a long time, I do have a somewhat 'funny' story about this particular novel.

Back in '91, when I was ten, my elementary school held a paper collection drive, at which we were told to gather all kinds of old paper and cardboard in the middle of our schoolyard, and deposit it into a large, metal dumpster, after which it would be carried off to be recycled. 

Rummaging through a pile of crummy magazines, pieces of cardboard, newspapers and so on, I stumbled upon a relatively pristine copy of Eco's 'The Name of the Rose', and decided I would like to read it - so I put it in my backpack for later. Yet, another pupil ('Albert' - I'll never forget that name) had spotted me doing this, and went over to our school principal to rat me out.

In a severe tone, I was then told by said principal that I was obligated to throw the book into the dumpster. So I did.

Suffice to say that that was the exact moment I'd lost all faith in our educational system.",4,2025-04-18T19:53:15,Finished reading Name of the Rose,books,good review reread long time somewhat funny story particular novel elementary school hold paper collection drive tell gather kind old paper cardboard middle schoolyard deposit large metal dumpster carry recycled rummage pile crummy magazine piece cardboard newspaper stumble relatively pristine copy eco rise decide like read backpack later pupil albert forget spot go school principal rat severe tone tell say principal obligate throw book dumpster suffice exact moment cd lose faith educational system,"good review reread long time somewhat funny story particular novel

"A fair warning, ""Foucault's Pendulum"" is a somewhat heavier read. I loved it but I've known people to find it hard, mostly because of how it's got pages and pages and pages of character just discussing historical minutiae. If that's your speed, then you won't find anything better.

I think I mentioned it in the other post, but for me ""Baudolino"" is the natural segue to ""The Name of the Rose"". It's breezy and enjoyable while being just as erudite and detailed. It's the story of a boy who gets adopted by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa as a sort of squire, and his adventures and intrigues both while following the emperor and afterwards, as he travels through Asia (which is not the real Asia, but rather the Asia that Europeans of the era imagined - full of fantastic beasts and strange tribes).

"It is a great book, although I have to admit I read it in English translation since I don't know any Italian.
I read it for the first time as a teenager, then I read it again after a decade of doing medieval reenactment and reading up on the medieval period and it turned out to be a very accurate book historically, aside from the deliberate anachronisms.  People really were arguing about theology like that at that time, and spectacles were still very new.  We have a letter from one friar to another in roughly 1270's saying that he had met the inventor of spectacles in city X. 

One thing I would say about Foucoult's Pendulum is that it can be a bit confusing and also not make much sense unless you have some familiarity with what you might call western esotericism, the mass of magic and religious thought which has formed over the last 200 years in Europe.

"I finally finished The Name of the Rose last November after spending years attempting to read it (I‚Äôm a non-Italian ESL) because I needed something to occupy my total attention to help me power through the weeks leading up to the U.S. election. The book absolutely blew me away. Although in choosing this book I was deliberately trying to stay away from subjects that speak too much about pressing present-day problems, I found Name of the Rose to be surprisingly relevant    as well. Especially with the different Catholic factions, most notably the poverty ones hating and fighting each other off even though at the end of the day, the non-poverty factions just looked at them with the same contempt and ultimately killed them all anyway. Therefore while that‚Äôs not the central conflict, it certainly makes you thing what‚Äôs the point of splitting hair and going after one another anyway when as a whole your group is at an immense disadvantage despite having the technically moral beliefs? I think Brother William of Baskerville expresses this exact exasperation at some point.

One thing that pissed me off about this book was when I looked up the monks‚Äô origins to see their nationalities and where they‚Äôre from, google freaking spoiled the villain to me so I knew the baddie the literal moment he appeared and completely missed the chance to be surprised! The ending is quite devastating IMO, and it was so sad to see the main duo having to part their lives. You can tell Adso really sees Brother William as a father figure and Brother William is very fond of Adso.

 ""It is foolish to think that you have to read all the books you buy, as it is foolish to criticize those who buy more books than they will ever be able to read.

""There are things in life that we need to always have plenty of supplies, even if we will only use a small portion. 

""If, for example, we consider books as medicine, we understand that it is good to have many at home rather than a few: when you want to feel better, then you go to the 'medicine closet' and choose a book. Not a random one, but the right book for that moment. That's why you should always have a nutrition choice! ""Those who buy only one book, read only that one and then get rid of it.

Being serious - I just sent this to MLB support:

Reading this article about Trump's latest blatantly racist attacks on our history (and on facts), I'm not giving another dime to anything MLB until you find the stones to speak out against this stuff. I've cancelled my mlb tv subscription (so it won't renew in April) and will  not be buying the tickets to multiple games we were planning to attend this year. My household will not be buying - or wearing - any MLB gear for the foreseeable future, and we're a baseball family. Stand up to the bully, and help defend against this horrifying sprint toward a dictatorship. Democracy and baseball are as American as it gets - SPEAK UP.

"I worked on the Harris campaign in PA as a field organizer for 2024, and let me tell you, this all rings really true.

I felt like the campaign was super behind the 8 ball with voter outreach, and finding out that the Trump campaign had been basically funneling all their efforts into algorithmic based ad campaigns on Facebook does not surprise me. 

The first day I worked there I got to attend a presentation by the digital engagement team in charge of all of PA, and they kept talking about ""vibes"" and ""Brat"" and the only social media they seemed to know about was Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. They had no bead on TikTok, and when I asked if they had any plans to leverage resources for reddit they gave me a blank stare and said ""What's reddit?""

The Harris campaign had hundreds of field organizers spending hours upon hours upon hours a DAY making cold calls with our cell phones to get people to knock on doors. Most people did not answer, but about 80% of the ones who did assumed we were telemarketers. They kept insisting that phone calls were key.

And my counter argument of ""Who answers a call from an unknown number in 2024?"" Was rebuked and I was told to ""trust the process"".

We had a person at each field office who was supposed to be in charge of all things social media. And they gave them no direction other than ""try to go viral"" and then eventually just made them all make phone calls too. It was so dumb.

The Democrats got beat because Trump was created by the internet and embraced it, while they were dinosaurs.

"Same as Brexit. 

The Brexit campaign micro targeted voters sending them messages that appealed specifically to them and their interests. It was shown that some voters were given messages that implied that Brexit would do the opposite of what other users were shown.

So in some scenarios groups of voters were encouraged to vote for Brexit to get one political outcome, and others were voting for Brexit to get a different outcome, where both outcomes were mutually exclusive.  

They didn't give a shit about delivering anything specific, they just wanted to win and lying to us, the voters, is simply a party of the game to those involved in these actions. For Brexit, this wasn't limited to social media though as the entire campaign promised all things to all people including membership of the single market on one hand, and leaving the single market on the other.

"This is a pure example of behavioral analysis, marketing and psychology being used for the wrong/bad. There are a million ways to nudge people to do things, like automatic opt in for retirement programs versus having to do the work to sign yourself up. The British government had what was called the Nudge Unit that did this very thing. There‚Äôs a book about it called Inside the Nudge Unit. They say at some point in the book that it should not be used for nefarious reasons but I guess that message didn‚Äôt make it to these folks. 

That being said, these techniques are used and people are completely unaware that they are being manipulated to make certain decisions or that their opinions are being influenced. And, they are willfully ignorant and defensive when it is brought to their attention. It would be a failure on their part to admit they are being unknowingly influenced. They want to believe they are fully in control of their world and opinions. It‚Äôs a paradigm shift to admit failure and that is something a majority of people are strongly unwilling to make, especially when it‚Äôs been made so visceral.

"Take note of some of the design decisions that convey subtle messages:  

First, the Russian ""influence"" is originating from the right, as viewed by the reader. That's very intentional but not overtly partisan. Second, the border between the red bricks and the White House isn't just jagged, it has disconnected red bricks in the White House side, using bricks as pixels and data bits, communicating the nature and methods of Russia's hacking and digital influence through swarms and torrents of data and propaganda.  

I appreciate when designers put in multiple layers of meaning like this.  

Edit: Also worth calling out (even if obvious), the hand-illustrated/screenprinted style of the art and the muted color tones match the style of Soviet-era propaganda posters.  

Examples: http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-most-sensational-and-lurid-soviet-propaganda-poster-1464264698/",760,2017-05-18T14:04:32,The new cover of TIME,Design,"note design decision convey subtle message

"This is the kind of thing I love. Two images in one!

I wish I'd been that clever when I was doing design, but I usually wasn't. I admire the designers who are, though. Even though I don't work in design anymore, I love to save stuff like this when I find it. It's just so neat. :)

I do have to agree with a lot of the other commenters here on the type, though. It could use some adjustments. Personally, I'd choose a lighter weight typeface (that might just be a preference, though). I'm also mildly annoyed by the way the ""in a"" is placed. It seems kind of wonky. It's hard for me to state exactly why, however. I think it's because 1) it's going above the letter height of the x right next to it and 2) it seems unbalanced, possibly because we have a longer word sitting on top of a smaller one. Looks like it's going to topple right over. Just a nitpick, though.

In regards to the typography...It looks like the typeface wasnt given much thought from the beginning. It was as if all the effort went into the icon design and then the type was made to fit into a compact shape. I'm not really a fan of the Gotham/geometric typefaces here and think there could've been more exploration around something condensed or with a little more playful in the terminals.

"I think you're onto something so I made some comps as well. I think the darker blue definitely makes it feel more serious/professional, however the light blue doesn't quite work without the red - you lose the ""patriotic"" feel. And I agree that the separation really helps with value. Logos should work in greyscale, as you pointed out.

I agree with others that the curved arrow doesn't promote 'stability' and forward thinking. I tried a version where it's only curved outside of the H and is mostly straight inside, and I don't think it works. But I get where you're coming from that the current arrow is too static.

So what if you use a more serious blue, keep the red and that fat arrow, but give the arrow just a *little* bit more of a curve?

Let's evaluate each others work based on the _effective_ use/abuse of the [principles of design,](http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf) _then_ let's talk about about how it _looks._ 

OP your approach with color really has given the logo a sense of unity to it. This rectifies the loss of the original repetitious geometry. That said, it now lacks asymmetry. Try giving it some depth, to loosen the flatness. See below to explore your iteration further. Thanks for sharing man!

"Oh Lord, designers I feel for ya. Oh Lord. I used to be audio engineer, lemme tell what we hear a lot, and what it means.

""Make it warmer"". This means something different to everyone. Usually it means add like a .5db sweep from 600-800. Maybe start at 1db at 500, and dip to like .25db at 1khz. Remember, Phon curve. If not that, run it through a tube compressor, physical or VST, slam it, then take out that part of the chain when they leave.

""can it sound more modern/radio friendly/brighter?"", slam it to -0.1db in a multiband compressor with a shitload of compression between 10-13k.

""Make it pop"", make the cymbals sound like shit then dial it back when they leave.

""Give it some kick/oomph/power"", kick the girlfriends guitarist out of the control room because what they mean is ""my boyfriends guitar isn't loud enough"".

""Make it sound like this record"", give up and use the plugin presets because no one fucking cares about a good mix and the presets sound good enough for todays homogenized indie band. Also I am guy with 16 preamps in a 12U flight box. That record you like was recorded on a Neve 8038. That ain't gonna happen. I can make it sound fucking great, I can blow your mind with how good it will sound, but I am not a dude with one of the best studios, and most coveted recording consoles in the world. Go away. Lower your expectations anything you record is going to sound like shit because it's 2016, you still haven't figured out how to play in time because your drummer refuses to play to a click, and you want to be the next ""Nirvana"". There is one Nirvana and you're 30 years late! Be something else!

""Since I'm doing the mix can you use all the bits and record it at -0.1?"", that means be glad you're a sole proprietor who paid an entertainment lawyer a fuckload of money for an airtight contract, then tell them to fuck off and they still owe you half.

""Why can't we just overdub?"", because you Mr. Bassist can't play in time and the reason your part sounds so different in the mix than it did in the studio is because I spent two hours off the clock re-recording every 4/4 120 I-III-V-VI key of C part you played. There's four strings and I've only seen you use three of them, and the 80/20 rule applies to that third one. How do you fuck it up? I DON'T EVEN PLAY BASS GUITAR! I PLAY DOUBLE BASS! My stupid ass had to prop a bass guitar up on a table and hold it vertically so I could figure out how to play it.

The biggest issue I have with the idea of ""accidentally deleting your account"" and B doing anything significant to prevent it is that B doesn't actually bring any type of assurance that the user really meant to delete their account, it just makes it harder for them to navigate said deletion.

"Here is my point of view,

Component A,

Clarity: The primary action (delete) is visually prominent with a red button, making it clear and easy to spot. The secondary action (cancel) is a text link, which is less visually dominant, indicating it‚Äôs the safer choice.

Usability: The red button for deletion aligns with common UI patterns for destructive actions, reducing the chance of accidental clicks. However, the text link for canceling might be less noticeable for some users.

Component B,

Clarity: The ""CANCEL"" button is clear, but the delete action lacks a label, which can cause confusion. Users might hesitate, unsure if the red outline button truly means ""delete.""

Usability: The lack of a label on the delete button violates UI best practices, as users need clear, explicit labels for destructive actions. This could lead to errors or hesitation.

Which is Better?

Component A is better because:
It provides clear labels for both actions, reducing ambiguity.

The red button for deletion follows standard UI conventions for destructive actions, making it intuitive.

The cancel option, while a text link, is still visible and less likely to be confused with the primary action.

"A. The accent color suffices. Having an additional accent along with the existing (button vs.trash icon) along with an inconsistent layout (wrapping images and title vs. Non-wrapping call to action list) adds additional cognitive burden in an already cognitively demanding task (deleting ones account).

Additionally, the natural intuition is that accent corresponds with the action in mind. Switching this breaks this and thus is inconsistent visual feedback adding an element of potential frustration. Good feedback is the cornerstone of good UX.

"If I may ask what field of design are you in ? 

Through my experience as a multimedia designer Iv found working with AI and incorporating it into my workflow is very appealing for future and present companies.

What I mean by this is, I know AI takes away from the creative process but only if you allow it. Instead of losing your job IE or another source of income.

Isn‚Äôt a better mentality to learn AI and see how it can help your workflows ? 

All I‚Äôm saying is the next smarter person will just say they know ai and have an advantage over you. 


As a designer, never stop learning and improving your craft. If that is using AI to an extent in your work. Then you should get with the times because the fact is every company is using AI in their creative teams. Whether it‚Äôs to generate stock images or help generate certain elements in the artwork. It‚Äôs just a harsh reality.

Iv found that more opportunities have opened as a creative when stipulating how I use flux and stable diffusion and all these ai models. 

Currently I am a senior Multimedia Designer at a large e-commerce site and we use AI to fast track a lot of our images we use. From upscaling, to adjusting poses of certain models and products. The grunt work is still being done by Photoshop but not having to scour shutterstock for hours is refreshing.

Speaking of which, every interview Iv been to lately has asked about my experience with AI as a designer. So take that as you will. 

Enough chit chat. Learn, progress and look at it as an opportunity rather than holding yourself back.

It could also be that your in a situation working with total cavemen and all of your excellent work is just lost on them.

"OK I've been exactly where you are, here are a couple of thoughts:

It sucks but it also shows you that no matter how much good work or good years you put in you're still not ""important"" to the company and things just go how they go. You have to come to terms with that. It's very difficult but it can be freeing too once you pass through the worst of it.

All those other skills they have you doing are actually valuable. I graduated with a design degree with a photo minor and worked in campus IT. In small companies like yours the more hats you wear the more valuable you are in terms of keeping you employed. When I was in the same boat you were I edited around 300 videos for YouTube. As sole web person, knowing SEO has helped me tremendously. It's not what you want to do be doing but it's worth learning. 

You still have a job. They found stuff for you to do. In this current employment environment that counts for a lot. I stuck it out through a similar period because I needed a paycheck and health insurance.

Now what to do:

Start applying to other jobs, you said its niche but work on your portfolio and start seeing what other employment opportunities are out there.

Wait it out. This is what I did. I had a new boss who was one of the most colossally arrogant ""I know how to do everything, I opened Photoshop once so I'm a designer"" people I've ever met. I was moved from salary to hourly, reclassified as a production artist, and just given tons of video work to do. It sucked. That person also managed to alienate everyone else in management, had a freakout and quit. My new boss is one of the absolute best people I've ever worked for. I was made salary again and given a huge raise when she took over. You might be able to just wait it out. 

Let the VP own everything. It's their show now so just let them go. If customers complain or suppliers or whoever, just let them eat it since they're responsible. Don't bail them out, don't fix the work they get on fiverr, you're not a designer anymore!

"I've been in this scenario before and with hindsight being 20/20, they are soft telling you that you will be let go if you don't leave first. For me, once my spidey-senses picked up those vibes, it was usually 2-3 months before the call came to be laid off. If you quit, they don't have to pay you unemployment. It is a very tough market for anyone right now, especially coders and designers.

I agree with others' advice on you calling yourself a Brand Manager, Product Designer, or similar. I would start by searching those jobs and take notes on the other suggestions being mentioned on those job sites. You also have enough experience for a manager, director, or VP role, so take a look at those resumes and apply to those too. I would schedule an interview with you right away.

Cover letters aren't worth much these days due to the high volume of applications received from recruiters and normies. So instead of spending your time on that part of the application, I would focus more on fine-tuning your resume a bit to match the job description. Don't be obvious or use AI. However, they will most definitely use an AI service for finding keywords, so remember to load your resume with those.

With your experience and devotion, companies will LOVE that even if you are disposable right now. In this market, you will have to keep your senses high and your resume fresh.

90-99% of what designers need to actually do can now be done without Adobe at all. GIMP in particular has come a long way, and so has Inkscape. Running Ubuntu Studio is like 10 to 100 times faster than Adobe on Windows or MacOS.

Sure, you don't get the system-wide integration of stuff like InDesign but it's not really that hard to plug in ID assets from alternate production sources like GIMP.

If you're a freelancer or independent that doesn't have to work with a whole department of people using Adobe CS/ID it's worth a look because it's all totally free open source.

All with no adware, bloatware, spyware or stupid crap like ads in the OS and software you already paid for.

You can download Ubuntu Studio and be up and running with a live boot USB drive to try it out in maybe an hour, and most of that is just downloading Ubuntu Studio and writing that disk image to a flash drive with the Rufus or baleenaEtcher utility.

"Have you actually tried it recently?

All of the standard fundamental tools for raster image editing are there and it basically looks and operates like pre-CS standalone Photoshop.

People are doing paid, pro work with GIMP now. It's not just hobbyists.

I'm also reminded that people used to say the same thing about CorelDraw! because Adobe stans hated the aesthetic and doofy built in clipart, and how people used that to make some really horrible designs for crap like junk mail and phone book ads.

The reality is that CorelDraw! did at least 10 to 100x the actual paid work because it was cheaper and more accessible than Illustrator.

It also had better bezier curve management at higher precision. Pre-CS Illustrator (and i think up until about CS 1 or 2) had a max document scale of about 24 feet and could barely handle millimeter precision at that scale without throwing bugs, and tended to crap out at around 250k-300k nodes.

CorelDraw! could handle FIFTY MILE WIDE documents with five decimal points of precision at mm scales, and easily handled node counts into the several millions.

There's a reason why CorelDraw! was in every CAD driven sign shop, vinyl cutter, screen printer and even large format print bureaus.

As a super old school graphic designer that grew up doing optical/analog layouts with actual pen, paper and film ""For hobbyists"" doesn't carry any weight, here, and Adobe is a fucking awful company anyway.

You can do all of the same masking, editing and image processing in GIMP that you can do in PS. All of the real tools that matter are there.

And, well, if you're relying on Photoshops more ""advanced"" features like AI cloning, warping or image generation because you can't do it the old school way? Or how to do a full magazine, catalog or book layout with thousands of assets without the integration of InDesign?

"I wouldn't say that it's a case of 'aesthetics' being prioritised; it's a case of brand being prioritised. The former would suggest the original icons were unattractive, which I don't think is the reason for the change.

As often happens when the brand has too much influence, it's at the expense of usability. It's now much more challenging to quickly identify the right app and the icons are much less accessible, as they have less distinguishing qualities. Visually, they blur together.

"Historically, generally the economy has done better under Democrat administrations. The Great Depression started under Republican President Hoover. The Great Recession started under Republican President Bush. In fact 10 of the last 11 economic recessions began under Republican Presidents.

Some cut and paste from epi:

Annual real GDP growth is 1.2 percentage points faster during Democratic administrations than Republican ones (3.79% versus 2.60%).

Total job growth has averaged 2.5% annually during Democratic administrations, while it is barely over 1% annually during Republican administrations. Applied to today‚Äôs total workforce, this would imply nearly 2.4 million more jobs created every year under Democratic administrations.

The Democratic advantage is even larger in private job growth than it is for total job growth. Notably, business investment is higher during Democratic administrations, with investment growth running at more than double the pace than it does during Republican ones.

Average rates of inflation‚Äîboth overall and ‚Äúcore‚Äù measures that exclude volatile food and energy prices‚Äîare slightly lower during Democratic administrations.

Families in the bottom 20% of the income distribution experience 188% faster income growth during Democratic administrations.

So, yes, if form follows, we will go into another recession or even a depression, and it will take the next Democrat President to spend his entire terms in office straightening out the Republican economic mess once again.",19,2025-02-20T16:22:13,"Economist Warns That Elon Musk Is About to Cause a ""Deep, Deep Recession""",Economics,historically generally economy well democrat administration great depression start republican president hoover great recession start republican president bush fact economic recession begin republican president cut paste dpi annual real gap growth percentage point fast democratic administration republican one versus total job growth average annually democratic administration barely annually republican administration apply today total workforce imply nearly job create year democratic administration democratic advantage large private job growth total job growth notably business investment high democratic administration investment growth run double pace republican one average rate inflation overall core measure exclude volatile food energy price slightly low democratic administration family income distribution experience fast income growth democratic administration yes form follow recession depression democrat president spend entire term office straighten republican economic mess,"historically generally economy well democrat administration great depression start republican president hoover great recession start republican president bush fact economic recession begin republican president

"Look folks. Here's some things to consider.

Tesla has made profit off their cars literally for one quarter since Elon took over (he didn't found Tesla, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning did that's why Elon is omitted on the wiki as a founder). Their money comes from reselling carbon credits to other businesses so they can look more green than they are. The rest all comes from government bail outs, which are 100% funded by the American tax payer. 

Elon's other businesses aren't profitable. Twitter has never been and social media in itself is quite hard to monetize. Ads are the last line for companies to make money and Elon has alienated a ton of investors since buying it. Twitter made 75% of its profits in 2023 from investors, which was a measly $2b, down over 20% from the previous year.

SpaceX, Starlink, Neurolink, Doge, and all his other pet projects all burn cash. None of them have any real products or revenue stream. Not legally anyway.

He's done stock manipulation and has milked crypto. All of which drained America's money.

So if he's worth $600b, and none of that has come from selling products to other countries (Tesla has never generated profit from its cars), the money all came from the American people. 

And now he's interfering with the legal and political system as well as using the presidency for his little 4chan memes and infuriating the world with racist gestures and epic gas lighting.

"Major Major's father was a sober God-fearing man whose idea of a good joke was to lie about his age. He was a long-limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money and was therefore wise. ‚ÄúAs ye sow, so shall ye reap,‚Äù he counseled one and all, and everyone said, ‚ÄúAmen.

"Which major company doesn't already have most of their manufacturing capabilities overseas anyways? 

The fear of businesses not having input materials may apply to small businesses that still produce things in the US, but for the companies in the stock market, the likes of Apple, Nvidia, etc., that isn't even a possibility in the first place, because they don't manufacture products in the US.

The more likely reason that these companies are losing value is because, since their manufacturing capabilities is overseas, and a lot of it in China, their products will be affected by the tariffs, and therefore they'll lose revenue in their sales to the US market.

That being said, i would hardly call this capital flight, because i fail to see any good investment opportunity anywhere else in the world to where that capital would fly, since basically every company is going to be affected by the tariffs, and therefore lose part of the US market.

"Call me crazy, but I suspect Canadian GDP and equities will outperform the United States over the coming decade. For several reasons. 

1. Lower interest rates in Canada (vs USA) will make it a more attractive investment destination. I expect interest rates in Canada will remain structurally lower than in the USA, due to Canada‚Äôs healthier fiscal position (lower debt), and USA‚Äôs weakening reserve currency status. 
2. Canada‚Äôs economy is heavily dependent on resource extraction, which is actually a good thing, since demand for resources are more durable than demand for services. In a recession, demand for fertilizer will be more durable than demand for Netflix and AirPods or whatever. 
3. We‚Äôve learned from previous trade wars that it really does not take long for counties to find new trading partners. If the USA won‚Äôt buy Canadian resources, Europe and Asia will.
4. Canada has had massive immigration over the past decade, which has recently depressed GDP per capita. But as those immigrants are absorbed into the workforce, and become more efficient, we should see them significantly boost per capita GDP over the coming decade. 
5. If the United States remains politically unstable, I expect many companies seeking serve the US market will locate in Canada, treating it as a politically stable safe haven.
6. Expanding on the previous point: Unlike the USA, Canada does not have massive tariffs on its economy. *All else being equal*, this will make it comparatively cheaper to operate a business out of Canada than the USA.

"Do you think the US economy will collapse in a couple weeks?

The effects of the tariffs have been adding up since trump put them up, market volatility, prices going up, trade relationships shifted, etc. It takes a little time for companies to start firing people due to all of this, and people not being able to buy luxury goods.

The US is a consumer economy, most likely 1-2 months after the tariffs were set, the average american will not be able to spend as much money, companies will either have to do layoffs to cover costs or rise prices (maybe both) and that will most likely spiral to a very bad place unless something happens.

Look at currencies not bound to the dollar like the Euro, the swiss franc, the moroccan dirham, etc, they are gaining a few points on the dollar since the tariffs happened. This means that everything imported to the US from those countries will be more expensive on top of the tariffs just due to currency exchange, and the consumers are the ones that will get the brunt of it. I'm not an expert, but if it walks like a duck, smells like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's most likely a duck.

"Creating massive supply chain issues with random and unclear tariff decisions and when they will stop is not going to be a temporary problem because people will realize we'll always be 2 years away from this being a thing again.

"IMO, bluffing would only really make sense if he'd made some actual demands or threats before putting them in place. But Trump has also proven again and again in words and attitudes to be a Mercantilist, he just doesn't get how international trade works. It's one of Trump's few fixed positions; he's been ranting about tariffs for 35 years at least. In fact he doesn't seem to get how much of anything works outside the NY real-estate market. I also think that Trump believes power not exercised is power wasted.

He also doesn't believe in mutually-beneficial deals, everything's a zero sum game. Either you're screwing over someone or you're getting screwed, and since the USA is the most powerful country, they're getting screwed if they're not pushing everyone else around constantly.

He's an extreme narcissist so he's sensitive to opinion shifts though, and what he wants most are 'wins' he can tout. Actually achieving anything is unimportant compared to making it _look like_ he did. So he's pushing without a specific goal to see what he can get out of it. He probably does want to bring back manufacturing - but at the same time he'd easily abandon that goal in favor of an easier and faster 'win'.

That's nuts. There is no emergency. The President can just lower the tariffs to fix the problem. Furthermore, changing rates to negate the tariffs also negates the entire point of the tariffs which was to bring jobs back! It literally incoherent madness.

"I remember back in 2008 when the market crashed, I had just started investing in stocks, and watching my portfolio plummet that day was one of the most stressful things I‚Äôve ever experienced. I had no idea what was going on, and my first instinct was to sell everything to avoid losing more. Luckily, I had a more experienced friend who convinced me to hold onto my investments instead of panicking. In the end, I didn‚Äôt lose as much as I thought I would, and over the years, I‚Äôve learned that these big drops are just part of the cycle. But man, those moments of uncertainty really test your patience and trust in the market.

Fast forward to now, and I find myself still holding through the ups and downs, but it never gets easier. Every time there‚Äôs a sharp drop, I feel that same panic rise, especially with how volatile things have been lately. It‚Äôs like you know logically that the market will rebound eventually, but emotionally it feels like you‚Äôre riding a rollercoaster. I‚Äôm curious if anyone else here has gone through the same cycle of emotions‚Äîdo you all just hold tight, or do you make moves when things go south?

"Can‚Äôt help but think this had little to nothing to do with JP.

Market confidence has basically been ground to 0 throughout the past 3 weeks.  Each swing upward and each swing downward tends to peel off more and more confidence in the market.  More people are divesting and pulling their money out with each volatile pump and dump.

For the first few pump and dumps it was like the market was searching for any sign of good news.  These days I think it‚Äôs largely resigned itself to a long-term downturn.  More people are more skeptical of ‚Äúbuying the dip,‚Äù and more people are betting against the market.

Personally I hopped out before liberation day and I‚Äôve been exclusively trading puts for as much profit as I can.  I think anyone buying shares right now is basically asking for pain.

"This has several implications. The first and obvious one is that there is roughly 600 more people per week filing in 2025 so roughly 5-6% each week. This is before all the effects of the current administration show in the numbers and thus an indicator that many had been already plagued with too many loans to  begin with.

Banks and credit card companies are usually insured against certain losses, so this will not have an immediate effect on them, but it might influence risk assessment of new loans. So it might get harder to get certain loans or they might become more expensive.

The second implication is that those filings are often used as an indicator for investors in terms of how healthy an economy is. So far we have had 'uncertainty' and ok numbers otherwise. These figures now change perception of those being deemed ok and a re-evaluation might take place. Since there is already pressure on several fronts, this is just another drop in the barrel of less enticing numbers.

Thirdly it could lead to those companies re-evaluating their overall credit risks, if this continues. It is one of the lessons learned from the last bubble (2008). One should also be aware of, that many a private debt has been re-packaged almost exactly as the house loans back in 2008.

Could be.  But aside from the screaming clickbait headline, we really don't have the data to tell.  Note that the article points to data for the end of 2024 and uses that to infer for 2025.  And at the end of the article points to filings for 2025 average 10,288 per week versus the 9,687 average for 2024 -- but this is a trend that we have been seeing [since 2022](https://www.bankruptcywatch.com/statistics), and still represents two or three bankruptcy filings per 100,000 people per year.

As far as credit cards go, we just don't have the publicly available stats to really say much of anything yet.  The latest Fed stats are for 2024Q4, when 30-day delinquencies on credit cards actually dropped slightly (to 3.08%) - the next Fed report for Q1 should be interesting.

"#Trump‚Äôs Tariffs Rattle Markets
##Wall Street Sinks in Historic Slump

It‚Äôs barely been three months since Donald Trump returned to the White House, yet the US stock market is already in the throes of its worst start to a presidency in modern history. The S&P 500 has shed 15 percent of its value since Inauguration Day and that grim tally does not even account for the further plunge predicted as markets open this week. Traders are bracing themselves and with good reason.

What began as a bull market inherited from the previous administration has turned decidedly bearish. And the main culprit, in the eyes of many, is the President‚Äôs economic playbook. Trump‚Äôs latest round of tariffs, unveiled with dramatic flair at his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù event, sent shockwaves through Wall Street. Promising a sweeping escalation of trade barriers, he alarmed the business world to such a degree that two-thirds of the market‚Äôs recent losses have come in the days since.

The timing could hardly be worse. The Nasdaq has already slipped into official bear market territory, as has the Russell 2000 index. The S&P is teetering on the edge. While markets are famously prone to fits of nerves, the speed and depth of this decline have drawn comparisons to some of the darkest days in recent economic history. The crashes of 1987 and 2008 and the COVID-19 shock of 2020 are all now part of the conversation.

This is not a case of inheriting a poisoned chalice either. When George W. Bush took office in 2001, the dot-com bubble had already burst, dragging markets down with it. Trump, in contrast, walked into a roaring bull market. In 2024, the S&P 500 surged 23 percent. Now, just weeks into his new term, the same index is spiralling in reverse and his policies are being blamed.

The tariffs, critics say, are acting like a tax on American consumers. David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors warns they are delivering a supply shock not unlike the oil crisis of the 1970s, stoking inflation while choking growth. That is an ugly combination for central banks trying to steady the ship. And while some Trump officials claim they aim to protect Main Street rather than Wall Street, the line between the two has grown increasingly blurred. Over 60 per cent of Americans have some stake in the market today through retirement accounts and investments. For them, falling share prices mean shrinking savings.

Confidence is a fragile thing. The danger now is that tumbling markets will spook companies and consumers alike. If businesses put the brakes on hiring and expansion and if households tighten their belts in response to dwindling portfolios, the damage could spread quickly. Some economists are already flashing warning signs. JPMorgan now puts the odds of a recession at 60 per cent, up from 40 per cent just weeks ago. Goldman Sachs and HSBC have also raised their estimates sharply.

There is even talk of the US slipping into its first recession so early in a presidency since 1953. Back then, the country was just emerging from the Korean War. This time, the only war in question is the trade war Trump himself ignited.

If things continue on this path, what we are witnessing may not simply be a temporary correction. It could be the beginning of a far more painful economic chapter, with Trump‚Äôs policies at its centre. Whether the President‚Äôs tough stance on trade pays off in the long run is anyone‚Äôs guess, but for now, Wall Street is not impressed.",180,2025-04-07T12:39:10,This is the stock market‚Äôs worst start to a presidential term in modern history,Economics,trump tariff rattle markets wall street sinks historic slump barely month donald trump return white house stock market throe worst start presidency modern history sep shed percent value inauguration day grim tally account plunge predict market open week trader brace good reason begin bull market inherit previous administration turn decidedly bearish main culprit eye president economic playbook trump late round tariff unveil dramatic flair liberation day event send shockwave wall street promise sweeping escalation trade barrier alarm business world degree third market recent loss come day time hardly bad nassau slip official bear market territory russell index sep teetering edge market famously prone fit nerve speed depth decline draw comparison darkest day recent economic history crash covid-19 shock conversation case inheriting poison chalice george bush take office dot com bubble burst drag market trump contrast walk roar bull market sep surge percent week new term index spiral reverse policy blame tariff critic act like tax american consumer david koto cumberland advisor warn deliver supply shock unlike oil crisis 1970s stoke inflation choke growth ugly combination central bank try steady ship trump official claim aim protect main street wall street line grow increasingly blur cent americans stake market today retirement account investment fall share price mean shrink saving confidence fragile thing danger tumbling market spook company consumer alike business brake hire expansion household tighten belt response dwindle portfolio damage spread quickly economist flash warning sign morgan put odd recession cent cent week ago goldman sachs sec raise estimate sharply talk slip recession early presidency country emerge korean war time war question trade war trump ignite thing continue path witness simply temporary correction begin far painful economic chapter trump policy centre president tough stance trade pay long run guess wall street impress,"trump tariff rattle market

"Calling it the worst does absolutely nothing. Terrifying him with catastrophic poll numbers, ensuring he understands his life is on the line from removal from office; where Republican lawmakers might get forced by their constituents to hold Donald Trump to account.

Impeachment looms ever closer as the various congressmen and senators contemplate their own removal from office in just 19 short months. That's a lot of terror that Mr. Trump needs to manage between here and there. I figure rats being what they are they will start crawling the walls over themselves when all they feel is fury and anger.

Now that billionaires are being forced to feel the same pain as everyone else, I suspect this amps up the relative risk for Mr. Trump to either get his shit together because if he doesn't stop for his wealthy buddies he has to recognize he might well find himself on one of those weird moments where like some Russian or Chinese billionaire that discovers they can't fly as they are helped out of a 50th story window.

"Interesting historical fact of the day: The Netherlands became the dominant trade juggernaut it was during the mid 17th century because amongst other things it had courts that protected investors. The other investment opportunities (like the spanish and portuguese ventures to the new world) were a lot more volatile because the rulers of those countries could just decide to take your money and not honor the debt.

So - what investors (and people in general) want are stable conditions to invest. How the fudge will you convince a person to invest X million dollars in an American factory if the next president (or even Trump) might decide to eliminate the tariffs, thereby changing the market conditions that made the investment viable in the first place. These things should be part of a cohesive strategy, with policies and a 10-20 year outlook. Not just a random guy waking up in the middle of the night and deciding that the stuff he heard on FOX news sounded great.

"The rationale is flawed.  You can bring manufacturing back to the US but you have to allow enough time for corporations to shift their supply chain and production.

"This all feels like Brexit (US Edition). An economic policy voted for by the electorate harms the economy. It isolates the country due to the rose-tinted spectacles of nostalgia and a lack of appreciation for how different global trade is compared to the good old days.

America will generally be fine. The economy will grow. The country is sufficiently large and advanced that it has the resources it needs to get by without the need to trade. But will it grow as fast as it could? Will it maintain its position as a global leader the way it did? Probably not.

The difficulty is that these counterfactuals are hard to prove and hard for people to recognise. In the UK, people complain about the cost of living as if we didn't impose a lasting and significant weakening of the pound.

"As people are pointing out, the USA is already the most prosperous country on the planet. This reminds me of the time in 2020 or so when Elon Musk was shitting on his workers constantly about needing to isolate and having a big laugh to slave drivers in sweatshops how his workers barely even work. At the time I wasn't clued on to his bs that much, but that gave me pause. Like he was already by any measure one of if not the richest person at the world at the time. His workers are who got him there, without the quality of their work he would be nowhere. What's he got to complain about? How much more could they have worked, to make him how much more rich? There should seriously never ever be a public statement by someone like him having a bad word to say about his workers ever. Did he say thank you? I don't know, maybe. But far out man.

Same here. Trump is hitting all the US's former friends like an insane meth head, all the people who have helped the USA become what it is now. It's not 1950 anymore. The rest of the world has the rest of the world to communicate, collaborate, trade and develop together. All the countries of the world can actually manage to cross one, quite big and significant in terms of market nonetheless, country off their list of trusted trading partners. They can manage. It really sucks so bad, but they can manage. But the USA has now crossed the entire world off their list. Meanwhile if you're any business person in the USA, you now have a foreign market of countries full of pissed off people of varying decorum. Some understand that your leader is an insane person, some go on a bit with all this bullshit, many others either try to avoid you from here on just in case, or are openly hostile and specifically boycott you as a matter of principle.

So how's that going to lead to anything good? All the other countries are going to take that medicine, and focus on their domestic industries and closer trading partners as well. Again where does this leave the USA? Something like 300 million people expecting a modern economy they're not gonna get anything anymore when most of the stuff comes from other countries. As is the case with every modern country, there simply is not any one country that produces everything they consume. Not even China does, though they're much closer to that.

"So what I see is the opinion of someone who worked for oboma.

Trump is not following a theory. This is actually proven fact that held true until 1975 when Jimmy Carter started to eliminate tariffs on goods coming into the United States.  The funniest part of the article is that he simply explains why our economy is currently broken while gossing over the details that make the difference.

He is correct when he was talking about taking in money in exchange for his knowledge and putting out money in exchange for goods.

But the detail that is missing is that our economy has been putting out more money than comes in since 1975, and would have gone tits up by now if it weren't for the $26T that has been used over time to keep up the status quo.

If we continue down the same path, we are on more money will flow out, and they will have to be replaced in an endless cycle.

"The thing I find interesting about all the tariff talk is the shifting motives and excuses for the tariffs. Sometimes it‚Äôs to ‚Äúequalize trade‚Äù with other countries (not how deficits work), sometimes it‚Äôs to punish other countries, sometimes it‚Äôs to bring manufacturing back to the US, sometimes it‚Äôs to raise tax revenue for income tax cuts.

The thing is none of these things are congruent or consistent with each other. If it‚Äôs to punish other countries, then presumably when they do what we want they come off, and therefore manufacturing wont actually come back to the US. If it is to bring back manufacturing, then once manufacturing is brought back to the US how is it going to raise tax revenue if everyone is buying American and not paying tariffs.

Most of the economic guidance is coming from MBAs, Finance folks, and Crypto bros. They seem to think what they are doing is coherent and will lead to some sort of long-term economic improvement in spite of all the evidence and overwhelming dissent of nearly all Economists of note globally.

> If you take this along with the absolute brain dead bullshit from DOGE it's increasing clear that we are being ran into the ground by the equivalent of Mckinsey/BCG/PWC.

The people in charge of most major businesses are fucking morons. At best, they can only plan two quarters in advance - and all they know how to do is maximize profit in that timeframe to the detriment to the future past that time. 

Occasionally you get a smarter consultant who will tell them something calming, like how a market correction is supposed to happen with a certain regularity. That calms the board room types such that they don't panic when they watch Trump crash Wall Street and erase 6 months of gains in 30 days - the consultants say this is normal, so they're okay. 

But they're still too stupid to realize that this is much, MUCH more like we've been flashed with an acute dose of radiation and we're dead already. In that analogy, we're in the ""Latent Period"", when all of the initial symptoms have abated and we're feeling better - the market still doesn't look great, but things haven't gone to shit yet...

Yet anyone who actually knows anything about radiation sickness (or what Trump is doing to the economy) knows that the worst is yet to come, and that the Latent Period is the calm before the storm.",169,2025-03-31T20:05:44,Trump Is About to Bet the Economy on a Theory That Makes No Sense,Economics,see pointed sub wallstreetbet remember pretty clear reading work sea chair stephen iran content signal chat whiskeygate administration fill true believer economic guidance come mas finance folk crypt bros think coherent lead sort long term economic improvement spite evidence overwhelming dissent nearly economist note globally absolute brain dead bullshit doge increase clear run ground equivalent mckinney big pc work company leadership like multiple time career master deflection start throw bus number popular support turn admin company recover take year drastic action dig stop right start fix thing immediately multiple quarter contraction wait go generation define disaster definitely lead country permanently poor modern legitimate cancer spread lymph node terminal midterm problem mckinney big pc type happen run wall street executive board room bluntly people charge major business fuck moron good plan quarter advance know maximize profit timeframe detriment future past time occasionally smart consultant tell calm like market correction suppose happen certain regularity calm board room type panic watch trump crash wall street erase month gain day consultant normal okay stupid realize like ave flash acute dose radiation dead analogy latent period initial symptom abate feel well market look great thing go shit actually know radiation sickness trump economy know worst come latent period calm storm,"see point sub /r wallstreetbet remember

- **Businesses understanding Trump is pay to play**. Trump is pretty openly corrupt at this point, and many businesses find that to be an easy game to play. Why view things at a macro level when you believe it will profit you in the short run?

"A ""drawbridge"" or ""draw bridge"" is a type of bridge. 

One definition of ""draw"" is to pull something, like a horse *draws* a wagon. 

A drawbridge is a bridge that has one or more sections that can be   raised (or drawn) upwards so that tall boats can pass by. When the boats are gone, the bridge is lowered so that it can be used by cars/people again.

Sometimes the bridge is in two pieces, with each half raised upwards like this \_/   \\\_.  Sometimes the bridge has one middle section that is raised upwards like this \_----\_.

"It's a very subtle difference grammatically/semantically. Normally when you use numbers, the number is the adjective and the counted object is a noun. As in ""Five dogs are sitting there"". The dogs are the subject, five is just describing their quantity. But when you talk about a measurement, the number is itself the subject, and thus sort of ""acts"" as the noun. When you say ""6 feet is tall"" or ""ten dollars is enough"", you are talking about the number; the units are not what is tall or enough, but the quantity.

"Nouns being converted to (non-existent) verbs for humorous effect is fairly common, especially on the internet. It's meant to emphasize that something exhibited characteristics typical to that thing, or that it is doing (or not doing) what is expected of it.

In this case, it's difficult to really know what it means because we didn't experience what he did on that day. However, we can imagine from the tone and context that it was negative. Probably a bad day for whatever reason, maybe work problems or something like that.

A separate, but very common example of this is 'the math isn't mathing'; this is a kind of newer expression with a similar meaning to the idiomatic phrase 'this doesn't add up', meaning something does not make logical sense. Or rather, that the logical premises of something do not align with the logical conclusion. Notice how 'doesn't add up' uses verbiage from math, 'to add (up)', which is probably where 'the math isn't mathing' came from. 

Math is very logical; 1 + 1 = 2, right? Well, take a hypothetical mysterious or difficult to understand situation. If it doesn't make sense, then 1 + 1 no longer seems to equal 2. That is when you could say 'the math isn't mathing'.

"A lot of people are saying to use ""sir"" or ""ma'am"", but in the UK, please don't do this. There are very specific cultural contexts where sir or Ma'am are expected, and using it otherwise can come across as passive aggressive. Only use it for positions of personal authority over you, such as your boss, and there are other forms of address you can use, such as ""officer"" for a policeman.

Generally, to be respectful and polite in English you just need to speak in a formal register.

Firstly, use greetings. Say ""good morning"" before noon, ""good afternoon"" between noon and five and ""good evening"" after five. Or just the simple ""hello"" or more casually ""hi"". At the end of a conversation say ""Goodbye"", ""bye"", or ""see you"" and then when you're going to next see them, e.g. ""see you tomorrow"". You might make a bit of small talk to someone if it's appropriate to the situation. ""How are you?"" ""Great/terrible weather we're having, aren't we?""

Secondly, consider how you word commands, requests or questions. Use please when you're making a command or request that the person wouldn't necessarily do, e.g. ""please keep left"". Only give a command if you've got authority to do so. If you're making a request, word it like ""please can you help me"". It's normally more polite to say ""Would you like"" rather than ""Do you want"".

When someone does something for you or gives you something, say ""thank you"" or ""thanks"". In return, say ""you're welcome"" or ""no problem"". 

This is culturally specific to Britain: When you do something wrong, or something goes wrong, say ""sorry"". If you need to get past someone, say sorry, I'd you need to grab someone's attention, you might say ""sorry, excuse me"".

You won't sound rude, so there's nothing to avoid. Many languages of the world do not have specific forms of address that reflect and reinforce social hierarchy (some don't even have second person pronouns at all!). 


Many of the world's languages express respect and deference nonverbally heavily relying on context, tone, and non-verbal cues to communicate these ideas. 


Icelandic has many distinctive words for snow that other languages do not have, as Arabic has several words for defining different types of sand that other languages do not. Languages all have very different lexicons that have evolved from culture, geography, lifestyle, tradition, values, upheavals, histories, diet, weather, etc.


Language is created by its users and reflects their communicative needs as they change over time. As we move between different languages we are not simply mapping words from one side of the dictionary to the other. 


We are shifting between different mindsets for communicating and expressing ideas in the most effective way appropriate to each language. This involves switching cultural and social habits that have shaped and influenced the different languages and how their speakers use their language and why. Learning another language is never just a matter of word substitution.",5,2025-04-19T14:11:21,"How can I speak respectfully in English without using honorifics like 'Anh', 'Ch·ªã', or 'Ch√∫'?",EnglishLearning,"want avoid sound rude overly casual speak old people high position

However, this does not mean that ‚Äúcould‚Äù is an automatically formal word. ‚ÄúI wish I could help you‚Äù is neither formal nor informal. 

If I were to summarize, formality in English comes from assuming the least about the speaker, and avoiding the command form.

"A historical context to add‚Äî‚Äúyou‚Äù is already formal.

But as everyone else has said, English now expresses formal register in other ways. I would say there are probably about four registers of different formality in most spoken English dialects.

"Generally in English speaking places hierarchal stuff is expressed more via other word choices and the general overall level of politeness, it's subtle and can be annoying for non-native speakers more used to a language with explicit honorific levels. 

  
""You"" isn't rude in English regardless of who you're speaking to, whether it's a random person on the street, the Pope, or a national leader.

What distinguishes speech upward on the hierarchy is more picking differential word choices, avoiding slang, and tending to say please and thank you more. 

for example, when dealing with a friend in an email or text I might say ""thx"" or just a thumbs up emoji. If I was dealing with someone who cared about social hierarchy and was ""above"" me I'd spell out ""thank you"" or even ""thank you for your time"".

Note that some people like to have a reputation for ""plain speaking"" or similar and will claim to prefer that their subordinates speak bluntly to them. Sometimes they actually mean it, other times they think they mean it but really don't. Take your cues from others at your social level when speaking to such people.

I've worked at a place where the owner really did mean it and vastly preferred us to straight up tell him that something was stupid bullshit if that's what we meant. I've worked at other places where the owner claimed to be like that, but in fact wanted some buttering up more formal type speech from us. So ""stupid bullshit"" might become ""not ideal"". 

Corporate speak, like ""leading to suboptimal outcomes"" can often come across as sarcastic, so be careful about it. Note also that phrases like ""as per my last email"" are widely known to have rude meanings. ""As per my last email"" means ""I already told you this you stupid asshole"" and should be avoided unless you mean to be on record as subtly calling someone an idiot.",2,2025-04-19T17:00:36,"How can I speak respectfully in English without using honorifics like 'Anh', 'Ch·ªã', or 'Ch√∫'?",EnglishLearning,"generally english speaking place hierarchal stuff express word choice general overall level politeness subtle annoying non native speaker language explicit honorific level

"As a native English speaker who has lived in several societies where formal vs informal forms of address are important, I have also thought a lot about this question. 

There is one answer for everyday formality, e.g., meeting the bank manager or interviewing for a job, and there is another for much rarer formal scenarios, such as addressing a member of the royal family. For the former, this comes down more to the use of ‚Äúplease,‚Äù ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù and other ways of interacting such as not interrupting or directly confronting someone. For the latter, there are specific rules around when to use ‚Äúsir,‚Äù ‚Äúmadam/ma‚Äôam,‚Äù and titles such as, ‚Äúyour highness/excellency.‚Äù 


Assuming you‚Äôre not getting invited to the palace any time soon, it really comes down to manners and deference. This is so culturally specific and based on each context, meaning UK is not the same as Australia (for example), and a tennis game with your girlfriend‚Äôs father is not the same as lunch with your new boss. It ultimately comes down to empathy with the person you are speaking with, and not coming across too brash or expert.",2,2025-04-22T11:14:53,"How can I speak respectfully in English without using honorifics like 'Anh', 'Ch·ªã', or 'Ch√∫'?",EnglishLearning,"native english speaker live society formal informal form address important thought lot question answer everyday formality edge meeting bank manager interview job rare formal scenario address member royal family comes use thank way interact interrupt directly confront specific rule use sir madam madam titles highness excellency

"Than is used in phrases like ""more than"" or ""less than"". The *than* is a word used in conjunction with a relative comparison word (more, less, bigger, smaller, cooler, hotter, higher, lower) to introduce the basis for comparison.

* I have more apples *than* oranges.
* My cake is hotter *than* your pie.
* He has smaller feet *than* she does.

""To"" is used in phrases that express logical relationships. The ""to"" still introduces the basis but the relationship is not comparative along a continuum.

* The number of apples is heavy *compared to* the oranges.
* This equation is *equivalent to* that equation.
* He is an expert in music as *opposed to* movies.

Preferring coffee *to* tea is best thought of an abbreviation of a more understandable coffee *as opposed to* tea. Unfortunately English is rife with these abbreviations of phrases which makes them hard to understand from basic structure.

"I **prefer** _[to have a cup of]_ coffee _[as opposed]_ **to** _[having a cup of]_ tea.

This is the sentence with the implied but unspoken parts shown _[in italics and enclosed in brackets]_ made explicit for clarity.

As you can see, most of this expression is implied instead of being spoken explicitly. It is only used when the speaker has been offered two things, and is being asked to choose one of them. 

The sentence is talking about stating a choice between two options based on preference. ""Prefer ... to"" is used in such sentences.

The word ""than"" is used in sentences that make comparisons between two things. ""Than"" is not a word that indicateds a choice.

The comparisons in which ""than"" is used are more abstract or hypothetical in nature. These statements refer to the qualities of two things, or are speculating about the possible outcomes of one thing in comparison with another thing. A typical sentence would be, ""Is this better than that?""

In the sentence that is shown in this post however, the expression is ""prefer ... to"".

""To"" is the correct answer because it is signaled by the use of the preceding word ""prefer.""

Traditionally, a ""toast"" was offered with a blessing/well-wishing for a person's health and good fortune. Sometimes it is still referred to as ""drinking a health"" (though that is now pretty old-fashioned, most native English speakers would still understand).

The reason it is called a ""toast"" is because one would float a piece of toast on top of a special cider-based drink--that tradition came out of English apple-harvesting celebrations a VERY long time ago!

"Yes, I would say so. I'm a native speaker with enough mastery of the language to become a professional author, editor, or English teacher if I so chose. Although I didn't major or minor in English in university, it was one of my two strongest subjects all throughout K-12, where I typically earned 98-100% semester averages. I minored in Mass Communications.

# Example #1 of my writing *(fictional story/joke comment)*:

> Once upon a time, there was a bursting, a thunder. Wisps of mystic chaos flaming and crackling, booming and roaring from out of a nearby wormhole. The skies of our world were lit with such force that the people below could only watch and tremble.
> 
> So busy were they looking up at the skies, no one noticed when it happened. Amid all the madness and all the uproar, a new creature appeared in our reality. It was a child, a child from unknown realms. A child, but *who?*
> 
> This, you see, was no ordinary person. Foreseen by the prophets, Equivalent_Ad1362 would one day grow to walk among us, browse the website known as Reddit, and somehow still have sex!
> 
> Few could fathom how this could be, or what it might mean, but soon, very soon they would begin to see‚Ä¶

# Example #2: The Letter *(Harry Potter fan fiction)*:

> Dear Mrs. Dursley,
> 
> I am afraid I must be the bearer of bad news. Your sister and brother-in-law are now dead, at the hand of a dark and troubled serial killer who has been terrorizing our world. In the attack, their home was also damaged, but the child! The child survived, thank heavens, with only a scratch upon his forehead!
>
> We are taking great measures to protect the boy, but he needs a place to stay, and someone to look after him until he is of age to attend our school. I now entrust this child into your care, and hope that you will raise him as if he were your own. He has your sister's eyes‚Ä¶ and her dying love.
> 
> My condolences,  
> ‚ÄîAlbus Dumbledore

# Example #3: A Father's Love *(fictional poem)*:

> From the gentle, tender smile with a glow in his eyes, to the warm comfort of his shoulder in the difficult times, there could be no hint of question. There could be no trace of doubt. Every morning to every evening, they were all he thought about.
> 
> He would take her to the water park and race her down the slide. They'd go out and play on picnics. He would seek and she would hide. He took sight of all her talents, always championing his pride. And when at times she struggled, he would guide her through the stride.
> 
> It was never any question. There was never any slight. He wrote love for all his children‚Ä¶ on his heart in black and white.
>
> Sarah, she grows older, and with each day she sees‚Ä¶ a new embrace of kindness, and what family's meant to be.

"Formally the grammar looks okay. The problem is more with the semantics of ‚Äòalways‚Äô used with a direct and simple action verb.

Much better: ‚ÄúHas he always come here?‚Äù

Why better? Because adding the auxiliary ‚Äòhas‚Äô contributes nothing except confusion. 

‚ÄúHe has always come here‚Äù completely answers the question about how long the activity has gone on.

‚ÄúHe has always been coming here‚Äù weakly suggests that the act of coming here has never been completed ‚Äî that he‚Äôs always been coming here but has never actually *arrived* here, which is ridiculous. 

But if you don‚Äôt mean it that way, don‚Äôt say it that way.

"This is a great question, because it highlights an area of English that isn't often used. Hopefully you're fairly far in your journey to learning English before you're covering this, but here's the problem:

'always been coming here' uses the **present perfect continuous** tense. What does this mean? Present tense mean it's happening now. Perfect tense indicates that an action or circumstance occurred at a different time period (usually earlier) than the time under consideration. So since we're talking about the present, and it's *been* happening. It's in the past. That's okay. There's nothing wrong with this so far. Continuous tense describes actions or situations that are ongoing or in progress at a certain time; they're not completed.

Putting this together means that he began coming at some time in the past and *has not yet finished* arriving. He's *always* been in the process of arriving, according to the statement.

To make this more correct, Cassie should have used the present perfect tense: 'Has he always come here?' To make it more correct, you'd typically want a timeframe or set of timeframes for reference For instance, 'Has he always come here for breakfast?' or 'Has he always come here on Christmas?""",2,2025-04-21T19:03:06,Why is this question considered ‚Äòawful English‚Äô?,EnglishLearning,great question highlight area english hopefully fairly far journey learn english covering problem come use present perfect continuous tense mean present tense mean happen perfect tense indicate action circumstance occur different time period usually early time consideration talk present happen past okay wrong far continuous tense describe action situation ongoing progress certain time complete put mean begin come time past finish arrive process arrive accord statement correct cassie present perfect tense come correct cd typically want timeframe set timeframe reference instance come breakfast come christmas,"great question highlight area english hopefully fairly far journey learn english covering problem

I can see that other commenters have said that Cassie's question seems natural to them. To me, it does not. To me, using the word *always* with that verb conjugation makes me wonder if ""he"" is stuck in some alternate, timeless dimension, always traveling toward ""here"" but never arriving.

Why? Maybe it's because the word *always* with a perfect verb means ""continuously"" (""We have always lived in Washington.""), while with a progressive verb it means ""repeatedly"" (""He is always making new friends.""). When you try to combine the two and use *always* with a perfect progressive verb, it just doesn't compute.

"This is probably going to upset you, but it's most likely because ""no one"" is considered formal speech, while nobody and none are considered casual speech. Written English tends to use formal writing. 

I try to spread this around when I can, but there IS a difference in English between spoken grammar and written grammar, due to a lengthy history of elitism and servitude, so our written grammar actually reflects more grammatical nuances of romance languages (French and Latin specifically), in that romance languages have formal conjugations that are used regularly while English did NOT, however due to French/Latin being the ""language of the elite"" centuries ago, our english speaking ancestors changed a LOT of our natural speaking rules to match the grammar of these languages to sound ""intelligent"" (and be taken more seriously) when they exchanged letters and wrote documents.

For example, two common rules are: 
- Don't end a sentence with a preposition (with, by, on, etc). In spoken English we do this all the time, but it is considered "" ungrammatical"" in written English. 
- Never start a sentence with a conjunction (but, because, and, etc). Again, very commonly done in spoken English, but will have the grammar nazis foaming at the mouth in written English.

So while you are correct, because this is in writing, you're no longer correct. ((Fun fact, this is also why some of our spelling (specifically British English) is so confusing, our words were meant to reflect French spelling, which is notorious for being unnecessarily superfluous).",1,2025-04-02T10:50:31,Why can't I say nobody instead of no one?,EnglishLearning,probably go upset likely consider formal speech consider casual speech write english tends use formal writing try spread difference english spoken grammar write grammar lengthy history elitism servitude write grammar actually reflect grammatical nuance romance language french latin specifically romance language formal conjugation regularly english french latin language elite century ago english speak ancestor change lot natural speaking rule match grammar language sound intelligent take seriously exchange letter write document example common rule end sentence preposition etc speak english time consider ungrammatical write english start sentence conjunction etc commonly speak english grammar nazi foam mouth write english correct writing long correct fun fact spell specifically british english confusing word mean reflect french spelling notorious unnecessarily superfluous,"probably go upset likely consider formal speech consider casual speech write english tends use formal writing

"C2, nice, mad respect for that... any loss you may experience comes at a very slow rate so don't worry too much. Even native speakers don't ever stop learning their own language. It's a journey there's no real finish line here. There are a couple of very obvious yet effective ways to make sure you don't become rusty:

1) Do some creative writing. Even Reddit itself goes a long way in that respect. It's a forum you can write a long-form reply to anyone on whatever topic. Dive into whatever you're interested in and hang around discussion forums. You'll be fine.  
2) Read literature. It could be fiction, non-fiction, whatever. Audiobooks help too.  
3) If you have friends who are native speakers of English just talk to them once in a while. It could be just chit-chat or deeper topics.   
4) If you come across something you're not sure of while reading or listening to something in English always look it up. I do it constantly myself, it's a force of habit. I hate ambiguity in comprehension. 

That's the best you can do, unless you have a job that's connected with knowing English then that's even better. Good luck on your future endeavors.",24,2025-03-25T09:59:11,How do I retain my English level?,EnglishLearning,"cd nice mad respect loss experience come slow rate worry native speaker stop learn language journey real finish line couple obvious effective way sure rusty creative writing geddit go long way respect forum write long form reply topic dive interested hang discussion forum fine read literature fiction non fiction audiobook help friend native speaker english talk chit chat deep topic

"I can 100% relate to this tbh. For the last two years I was in an environment where I practiced my English skills every day, both in terms of communication and grammar, so I always was being challenged and my English was at its most fluent.

Then I noticed that almost as soon as I left that environment those skills started to rust. Suddenly I'm using awkward expressions that when I re-read them seem off, I use a ""to"" where a ""for"" is needed, an ""in"" where a ""on"" is grammatical, etc. I also noticed my accent isn‚Äôt as ""natural"" either, certainly not as natural as when I practiced my speaking skills everyday.


Overall I try not to worry too much about this tho, because I don't have an external pressure to communicate at my best now. Some things might fade but I think language proficiency is like riding a bike,  once you really understand it you never really forget it, even if you lose practice. I wouldn't worry too much if I were you either since C2 is the highest certification and it shows your skills are already at a very high level, most jobs or colleges will ask for a B2 level if they ask at all, so your level is more than enough.

 If for personal reasons you really feel you need to keep pushing yourself, maybe you could try joining environment where your skills are always being challenged as well? Discord servers, VC on online games, joining writting projects, etc. The internet is very American-centric so most English speaking communities will be full of natives. You could also give lessons if you have the time, both tutoring or in a classroom setting. You'll keep your skills sharp and make some money too! All in all, as others have pointed out, I wouldn't overthink it too much, English in its entirety will not evaporate from your head if you don't use it everyday.",3,2025-03-25T11:42:54,How do I retain my English level?,EnglishLearning,"relate tbs year environment practice english skill day term communication grammar challenge english fluent notice soon leave environment skill start rust suddenly pm awkward expression read use need grammatical etc notice accent natural certainly natural practice speaking skill everyday

"One of my most enduring video game memories is from the original EverQuest. I had started a new job doing tech support for dialup internet and had made acquaintances with a few of the gamers in the office. 

EQ was the first real MMO I had played, and everything was larger than life. I had no context for anything I was seeing. I had created a dwarf warrior I think it was and Dave from the office met up with me on his high level wizard. He brought me to North Ro, outside of Freeport.

We teleported to the spires there which was amazing and really captured the imagination. But what really stood out were the giant scarabs. I had no idea what they were except they were enormous compared to my dwarf. Dave--I wish I could remember his character name--casually blew them up in one shot and then even beat one to death with his staff.

I have a ton of other really great EQ memories, but that's the earliest and most dear. The sense of wonder and scale from that time has rarely been fully recaptured since then.

"I've been gaming since I was in middle school and I've always been very careful about mentioning gender when I play online. The amount of harassment is just not worth it.

That being said the number of requests to aol/msn messenger, skype, facetime ect that I got in direct messaging was always intense.

Now that I'm married it's a whole different thing. When guys find out I'm a chick and tell them I'm married suddenly is HIGHLY offensive to them. Like how dare I not be just single and waiting for them to come alone and sweep me off my feet. Lots of requests for ""just some pics, he doesn't have to know"" like I'd ditch a perfectly happy marriage for some random jackass on the internet.

"This is a strategy which once failed for my parents one Christmas Eve.

I was given a slot car racer track, and because we were driving to the other grandparents house on Christmas day, I was told I could stay up until I crashed. The other thing to know, which properly frames the situation, is that the power distribution for a track like this is flawed. When you squeeze the trigger for both controllers, and there are two cars on the track, the power is distributed pretty evenly, but if one of the cars is knocked off the track or your opponent releases their trigger to break suddenly, then that power is instantaneously transferred to the other car and car number 2 sees a comparable boost in acceleration and velocity for the exact same applied trigger pressure.

When I went to college I studied Electrical Engineering, and it makes sense as both tracks are wired in parallel, but at the time, it was just known as the method to knock your opponent from the track. Both racers accelerate so they are going as fast as they can without getting thrown from the track, then just before your opponent enters a turn, you drop your throttle and watch as your opponent now finds themselves accelerating into a turn.

"Im all onboard the EA hate train as i was looking forward to this, and although i didnt pre order as i dont belive it has a place in todays digital age, its another game i wont be buying.

But more importantly, you guys pitch forking at EA are missing the obvious. EA doesnt own star wars, Disney does and if theres one thing Disney absolutely will not tollerate, its bad press surrounding their brand. You want to punish EA? Then you need to take to social media and tag disney in this shitshow and express your disgust at their assosiation with gambling boxes in video games obviously aimed at children. 

I would imagine should bad press go viral enough for disney to notice, theyd be calling a board meeting with EA pretty sharpish.

"I keep saying this to all my friends. What really needs to happen is for E3 to roll around. Let all the video game and console devs do their presentation. Then; when EA steps out, and only when EA steps out, people collectively 'boo' and turn their backs throughout the whole presentation. The only thing gamers can do short of buying absolutely 0 EA games (unlikely) which would tank stocks, is to show them their actions have reached a pinnical of disappointment for their consumers. That gamers wont even be bothered to be aware/present at their biggest yearly exposition.

Edit: even I can't believe THIS is my top rated comment. I always assumed ""RIP inbox"" was a joke.

Edit #2: Ok so since this is still a comment people are latching onto and I have access to my computer now, I guess I should make as few things a little clearer. I know it's all paid-to-clap press. Those people are paid to write 'best in E3 show!' 'Battlefront 2 made me cry!' '#newEAgamelooksdope' bias is part of their resume. 'Yes man' their label. My point is that it would have to get to that moment where even the paid to gold seal 'reporters' have had enough. Sadly, there will never be a universal ban on one publisher. For those who've been in a guild, it's common knowledge gamers rarely will work together for the better of the whole without having their ego stroked as the one. I would assume this applies double for trying to ban a publisher. At this point, all you can do is the single most damaging thing to a major corporation; and that is to tank their stocks. Their PR will kiss shit stained player ass and do it with a smile. That's their job. What we need to start thinking as a whole collective is how to make their stock holders and CEO's start applying rose red lipstick and considering their go-to tongue action move. This means, actively boycotting all their products. Which nobody will do. I'm favor of a comment I saw where someone suggested, as far as Battlefront II was concerned, attack Disney. I agree with u/roxwar. >EA doesnt own star wars, Disney does and if theres one thing Disney absolutely will not tollerate, its bad press surrounding their brand. You want to punish EA? Then you need to take to social media and tag disney in this shitshow and express your disgust at their assosiation with gambling boxes in video games obviously aimed at children.

I'd assume Disney saw the EA stocks and figured they could do no wrong. Disney stopped selling magic and childhood dreams mid-80's. What the fuck do they know about fun and happiness (anybody who points to their theme parks have clearly never stood 4-hours in line for a five minute ride)? That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games. We must learn to adult as gamers.",8737,2017-11-13T18:13:45,Can we please boycott Star Wars battlefront 2,gaming,say friend need happen roll let video game console deus presentation step step people collectively boo turn back presentation thing gamer short buying absolutely game unlikely tank stock action reach pinnical disappointment consumer gamer bother aware present big yearly exposition edit believe rate comment assume rip inbox joke edit comment people latch access computer guess thing little clear know pay clap press people pay write good battlefront cry neweagamelooksdope bias resume yes man label point moment pay gold seal reporter sadly universal ban publisher ave guild common knowledge gamer rarely work well have ego stroke assume apply double try ban publisher point single damaging thing major corporation tank stock kiss shit stain player ass smile job need start think collective stock holder co start apply rise red lipstick consider tongue action mean actively boycott product pm favor comment see suggest far battlefront ii concern attack disney agree rowan star war disney thing disney absolutely tolerate bad press surround brand want punish need social medium tag disney shitshow express disgust association gambling box video game obviously aim child cd assume disney see stock figure wrong disney stop sell magic childhood dream mid-80 fuck know fun happiness anybody point theme park clearly stand hour line minute ride mean need stop cycle industry bitch fuck responsibility way practice practical gamer show viable business model like pay gold subscription box dec skin change gun character sloppy shoddy irrelevant order bonus game release buggy deadline meet rarely fix cash come gamer want responsible publisher game de responsible consumer game learn adult gamer,"say friend need happen e3 roll let video game console devs presentation ea step ea step people collectively boo turn back presentation thing gamer short buy absolutely ea game unlikely tank stock action reach pinnical disappointment consumer gamer will not bother aware present big yearly exposition

"I officially began my EA boycott last year.  It started with NHL.  My buddies and I are hockey mega fans, and we loved teaming up on the EA Sports Hockey League.  We got the game every year... always hype for the early release in September!  But then nothing in the game was ever improving, the game felt worse with each release.  Each iteration of the game felt like a dumb downed recycled version of the last.  Every year the game felt more random and we were losing actual control of of our players.  Frustration finally led to all of us not buying 17.  My brother tried the 18 beta and was like yeah nevermind I know why we stopped.  


The only thing they update and care about is their HUT bullshit.  Because people drop stacks to buy more and more card packs.   Our boycott hurts, I miss hockey, but I finally decided after 4 years of declining user experience it was finally time.  Maybe one day EA will release a hockey game again that isn't so focused on micro transactions.  Or better yet maybe another company can make a damn hockey game.

"What EA is doing breaks my heart.  The original PS2 Battlefront games were some of my favorite games ever made.  I probably spent close to a thousand hours playing Battlefront II with my friends back in the day.  It was our go-to game for sleepovers and hangouts because we were all such big Star Wars nerds.  When they announced that there was finally going to be a new Battlefront game, I was so excited.  I couldn't wait to rush out and buy it the second it came out!  It was going to be just like the beloved games of my childhood.

And then it turned out to be a toxic pile of sludge.  I never bought it.  I won't be buying EA's Battlefront 2 either.  And the whole thing just makes me really sad.

After the disappointment of EA's first Battlefront game, I discovered that the original Star Wars Battlefront 2 is available on steam for like $5-10. So I bought it, and I've pumped a crazy number of hours into it all over again with friends over the past year.  And you know what, the fun we've had with it has been worth every penny.

"Cancelled my Battlefront II pre-order. 

EA have sucked the soul out of this game, I'm not dumping 40 hours into this game Just so i have enough in-game credits to buy Darth Vader and nothing else.

When a grind of this magnitude is introduced into a game, players automatically look for a way speed up or bypass their progression, it makes it obvious that this is obnoxious bait to get you to succumb to their micro-transactions, why would people spend 40 hours of their busy lives trying to unlock one thing when they could just pay some arbitrary fee to unlock it instantly, Its forced convenience, It's shady, and its a disease afflicting modern gaming.

Its real shame too, 'cause I love Star Wars and the game itself looks fun as hell, but when a company like EA is so blatantly stretching out progression to insane levels, only to ask us for more money to make it shorter? its hard to enjoy it.

We are not playing Candy Crush here, these are Triple-A games, where progression should be fair and balanced and react to the skill and effort of the one playing, not the whims of Corporate exec's trying to line their back pockets with the money of people who don't know better.

Screw you EA, you won't get my money.

It was more of rushed outpouring of my thoughts at the time rather than a well put together argument.

"My father in law doesn't really play a lot of video games. He especially doesn't play shooters. But he loves Star Wars, absolutely adores it and everything related to it. In recent years he works less than he used to so when they released that PS4 package with battlefront and the darth Vader skin he bought it. Since the day he bought that he plays it for at least a while every single day he can. He could give a shit how it compares to other shooters, he doesn't care about shooters the last game he played on console was probably crash bandicoot. He doesn't care if it's expensive he has plenty of money and it's like the only game he has to pay for anyway. I guarantee you he already has the most expensive version preordered and he will drop a couple hundred on release if he has to to unlock everything. He doesn't care about video games or developer ethics, he just really really likes Star Wars, and the battlefield style gameplay and graphics really immerse him in the universe he loves.

This game is for him not you and EA knows that. 

That's why EA bought the rights.

That's why EA could give a shit if redditors play the game, after the last release they knew half of us would shit on it even if it was perfect and none of us would spend any real money.

"Use to work at a retro game store so I can explain the price policy and I actually agree with what you got.

Those 360s are next to nothing cause it looks like no cables and not enough controllers ( controllers are 90% of the value you would get trading in a console).

We were a small store and only had 4 location in the area. Know how many BACKSTOCK 360s we had? Over 1000. Yeah. That's how often they came in.

Guess how many Wiis we had? Well over 500. That's Backstock too. This is not including what we had completed and ready to sell.

So guess how much we offered for consoles? 5 dollars. That's all you get for consoles with no cables/controllers. And yet people still sold it to us. It got so bad we started to refuse both Wiis and 360s.

The PS3 I wish I could see the other side because if it had 4 USB slots...we would have paid money for it regardless if it had cables/controllers but you would definitely get more if you did. Fat PS3s with 4 USB slots in the front is Backwards Compatible. That means it plays PS2 games as well ( all PS3s could play PS3 and PS1 games but only that model could also do PS2 ).

"""Fun gameplay"" and ""good writing"" are entirely subjective. The biggest issue is people that are happy and having fun tend to not say anything. Meanwhile, people that are miserable and hate things never shut up and never seem to be appeased. The only other metric is sales. Which raises another issue. If people buy a game and it sucks, it still sold well which would be feedback it was good. If people sleep on a game due to previously mentioned public negativity and don't buy a game, that says the game was bad. This has created a situation where the people making games are unlikely to get clear, useful feedback. They can do playtests, but we all know that gets leaked which is another kind of issue.

"Question: are your kids sleeping in on the weekends? If not, I'm pretty sure I know what the issue is and parenting duties need to be more evenly split off work hours. Being a morning person is not the same as being the only parent in charge in the mornings and having to force kids to tip toe around a sleeping parent. Same issue would be going with taking care of the dogs. That's a hell of a lot for one person to be wrangling every morning on the weekends. This cannot be an every weekend schedule because it's likely causing a problem with your wife. Use your head for a minute and think about what always sleeping in on off days actually looks like for your wife. Sometimes, people want a relaxing morning, awake or not.

And make sure you are very aware of noise levels when gaming while people are asleep. Wearing headphones is not enough- you need to make sure you yourself are not yelling or being loud. Especially with young children. If they are being woken up, that's another issue that can be setting her off. It's unclear if that's a factor in your post, so I'm mentioning it. Another consideration is are you putting the same efforts into maintaining your marriage as you are gaming, something else that sets partners off. 

Playing games is a perfectly fine way to de-stress as long as you are balancing your responsibilities and relationships well. This also means being present and not tired when you are with your family. Normally, when a spouse is lashing out like this, something is not going right with the balance, so make sure you are sitting and communicating with your wife. This means listening to her and what is stressing her out, not just focusing on how it's impacting you and what's centered on you. These comments are typically warning signs something is not right in your relationship. Your wife is telling you she's unhappy. Listen. Then be willing to compromise here- there's actions such as revisiting gaming schedules, having some more boundaries on both ends, that cam make your marriage smoother",67,2025-04-10T15:41:33,My wife thinks video games are juvenile and playing them makes me less attractive.,gaming,question kid sleep weekend pm pretty sure know issue parenting duty need evenly split work hour morning person parent charge morning have force kid tip toe sleep parent issue go take care dog hell lot person wrangle morning weekend weekend schedule likely cause problem wife use head minute think sleeping day actually look like wife people want relax morning awake sure aware noise level game people asleep wear headphone need sure yelling loud especially young child wake issue set unclear factor post pm mention consideration put effort maintain marriage gaming set partner play game perfectly fine way de stress long balance responsibility relationship mean present tired family normally spouse lash like go right balance sure sitting communicate wife mean listen stress focus impact enter comment typically warn sign right relationship wife tell unhappy listen willing compromise action revisit gaming schedule have boundary end cam marriage smooth,"question kid sleep weekend pretty sure know issue parenting duty need evenly split work hour morning person parent charge morning have force kid tip toe sleep parent issue go take care dog hell lot person wrangle morning weekend weekend schedule likely cause problem wife use head minute think sleeping day actually look like wife people want relax morning awake

"Let me tell you about a trap I fell into: I can't stand TV, I find it boring, and when I'm bored I pull out my phone. 

After a while I stopped even bothering to sit down on the couch for TV at night. This meant I didn't get the chance to decompress and have adult conversation with my wife after chores and dinner and the bedtime routine. Instead I'd go sit and play games instead. 

Whether it was my intention or not, the message my wife received was that I don't like spending time with her. This had all kinds of knock on effects. 

Of course I was oblivious to this. In my mind, I just hated TV trash and I work too hard to waste my evenings sitting on the couch scrolling through my phone when there is an awesome engaging hobby that I love in the other room. 

Back to you: You work all week then come Friday you are choosing to spend your Friday nights away from your wife. Afterwards you sleep in. A lot of your time that your wife feels she deserves is being given to that evil gaming hobby. 

It's not right, it's not fair. But that's how she sees it. She'll deny it, but that's why. Also if she seems to be acting irrationally elsewhere, there's a fair chance it's just shitty communication and redirected feelings from this issue.",6,2025-04-10T16:03:03,My wife thinks video games are juvenile and playing them makes me less attractive.,gaming,let tell trap fall stand find boring pm bored pull phone stop bother sit couch night mean chance decompress adult conversation wife chore dinner bedtime routine instead cd sit play game instead intention message wife receive like spend time kind knock effect course oblivious mind hate trash work hard waste evening sit couch scroll phone awesome engage hobby love room work week come friday choosing spend friday night away wife sleep lot time wife feel deserve give evil gaming hobby right fair see deny act irrationally fair chance shitty communication redirect feeling issue,"let tell trap fall stand tv find boring bored pull phone

"50 years ago it would have been books. At this point though I wouldn't go looking for any zingers just to win an argument. This is something the two of you need to seriously discuss. What someone does for their personal hobby is up to them as long as it doesn't bring hardship on the family, as I'm sure she wouldn't want you to be overly critical of her hobbies either.

Generally, it showcases a possible lack of emotional intelligence for someone to criticize anothers hobbies on the basis of them being ""juvenile"" or ""unattractive"". For me, thinking that way is far more unattractive. Lots of dudes in their 40s just watch sports, which isn't all that more productive, but people should be able to do what they enjoy as long as it doesn't harm anyone around them. This is just my gut reaction though, without knowing her personally I think this is a deeper relationship issue that is just coming up through this criticism.

"I‚Äôm currently on an indefinite round-the-world bicycle tour, and spent two months this summer bikepacking Mongolia & wanted to share some thoughts and photos.

Mongolia is definitely not a place you want to come to unprepared, especially if you want to venture further inland rather than just following the handful of asphalt roads. Only 20% of roads in the country are paved!

So get yourself some wide tires and know how to repair your bike - it‚Äôs unlikely to come across a bikestore in the countryside of the least densely populated country in the world üòâ

I spent majority of my time in the Altai Mountains in the far west of the country, where most locals are actually ethnically Kazakh. Since Mongolia was never part of the Soviet Union, the Kazakhs here actually managed to preserve their culture better than those in modern-day Kazakhstan.

Encounters were always nice, you will be offered plenty of Airag (fermented horse milk) and rock-hard cheese. But the food isn‚Äôt the reason you come to Mongolia, it‚Äôs to experience the way of life of the nomads and to enjoy the nature and remoteness.

Those things can be quite challenging at times, not only does it require one to carry food for multiple days, drink water from streams and rivers (bring a good filter!) but it also requires a sturdy tent. I had multiple nights where I had to reinforce my tent wall with my body so it doesn‚Äôt collapse, because of super strong winds. I also experienced a snowstorm in June while crossing one of the 3000m passes.

One minor mishap I had was when I got a deep cut in my foot because I slipped during a river crossing - luckily I was close to a village but it‚Äôs better to have a sufficient first aid kit in case you are in the middle of nowhere. There is also little to no cellphone service outside of the settlements, so an SOS beacon could be a wise investment.

In the villages you will find a pharmacy and a couple mini-markets, but don‚Äôt always expect restaurants or homestays. These small grocery stores are surprisingly well stocked, in my experience it‚Äôs easier to find what you need here than in big cities in China!

After over a month in the Altai Mountains I made it to the next ‚Äúbig‚Äù city to witness the Naadam, Mongolia‚Äôs biggest annual festival. Celebrating their culture with traditional outfits and dances, as well as the ‚ÄúThree Games of Men‚Äù: Horse racing, wrestling and archery (where women also compete). It was a show that I won‚Äôt forget, and you shouldn‚Äôt miss if you visit Mongolia during summer.

After skipping a few hundred kilometres of the asphalt road through the Gobi desert by bus I cycled another loop in the Khanghai mountains in the centre of the country, where the nature was similarly beautiful and slightly less rugged. It was a bit greener which meant more nomads, and a lot more livestock - yak, sheep, goats and a couple horses.

I then continued my way towards Ulaanbaatar, the capital, where I got my Chinese visa for the next adventure- the Tibetan Plateau (where I am now).

Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming support, unfortunately I can‚Äôt respond to everyone. I will post some pics from other countries I‚Äôve cycled across in the coming days. ü´°",2988,2024-10-05T05:37:34,I cycled across Mongolia.

A few questions.

First, few people would do what you did.  What, in your personality, or those who do similar things attracts you to do something like this.  I'm reminded of ""Into the Wild"" about Chris McCandless giving up what seems like a traditional successful lifestyle to just go out and live whereever (within the US).  He's frequently criticized for being an idiot and dying due to lack of knowledge of living in nature.  Unfortunately, it obscures the idea that he gave up a traditional 9-5 job that would likely have paid well, a decision very few people in his position make.

And how long do you think you'll do this.  Since you started around the pandemic, that would be about 4 years.  Do you expect to live this way indefinitely?

"What seems like a lifetime ago, I lived down in Central TX (Killeen for the ones who would know üôÑ) and had a similar situation. I had just moved in, and was at the mailboxes (the development was broken up into quadrants and each one had its own area with a big ‚Äúbank‚Äù of mailboxes) and got to chatting with one of the neighbors. She informs me that her family is having a cookout, and that I should swing by. 

Normally I‚Äôm an incredibly reserved person and would never lol but I had moved from Maryland to Texas to live with my best friend at the time while he was in the Army who then went back home for a visit a week after discharge and just kinda never returned, so I just moved out (since technically I was never actually on the lease üòÇ). Due to this and my reluctance to return home with my tail tucked, and also I was getting the vibe that she was into me so I said fuck it and decided to go. 

I waited about an hour after the time she told me that it started and headed out the door and started walking. I then realized that I never got the address (I was incredibly shy and had low self esteem back then, I was not great at communicating effectively with women especially if they showed even an ounce of interest lmao), just the general street that I saw her walk back down so I just started walking in that direction. About halfway down that street I heard the loudest party sounds I‚Äôd ever heard and figured that was the place so I walked into the backyard and started scanning around for the woman that had invited me.

After a few minutes, I realized that not only do I not see her, but I‚Äôm the only white person in this yard. Literally everyone else is very obviously of some sort of Spanish-speaking lineage. I start asking for Maria in what little Spanish I remember from high school and I‚Äôm met with about 100 confused looks when they hear my awful Spanish, followed by them pointing at one of about 25 different women at that party named Maria. At one point a man with a comically large cowboy hat and belt buckle shoved a 24oz Modelo in my hand when asked where Maria was, so once again I said fuck it I‚Äôm already here so I sat down to enjoy my beer and just take it all in. 

A few moments later, an elderly woman sits down with me and in English as broken as my Spanish asks who I am, who I‚Äôm looking for, etc. so I tell her my story. She starts laughing hysterically and calls over at least a dozen other Abuelitas and tells them my story, to which they all respond similarly. She comes back after they all chat a bit, and tells me that the family I‚Äôm looking for lives on the next street over. Apparently I saw her walk down this street bc she was on her way to this literal house to wish a happy 15th birthday to the girl that lived here.

Now I‚Äôm the first to admit that I was extremely naive to  a lot of traditions of other cultures (still am, but I‚Äôve been actively trying to learn and expand what I know of cultures other than my own) but I knew how big of a deal that was and I was immediately mortified. I just barged into some girls fucking QUINCE√ëERA, and I‚Äôm just sitting there like I belong with a beer in my hand and I‚Äôm sure the most curious mix of utter embarrassment and shame on my face. 

The Abuelitas all assured me it was fine I was there and insisted that I eat some of the food and have more beer and tequila. The food was some of the best I‚Äôve ever had, and to this day I‚Äôve never seen that brand of tequila on a store shelf here in the states but it converted me into a tequila fan for life. I ended up having a great time, made some great friends in the area for the rest of the time I was living there, and the father actually walked with me over to the party I was originally supposed to attend and introduced me as the gringo that crashed his daughters Quince√±era to many appalled faces until he very rapidly in Spanish explained what happened. I do have to say, I admire how quickly and efficiently they seem to be able to say everything that needs to be said üòÇ. Stayed at the second party til the sun came up the next day and made even more friends.

"Honestly, you did exactly what you set out to do. Life changing experiences don't feel that way when they happen. You realize later how important it was.¬†


You discovered the most important lesson of all: that life is about authenticity and connection. That the best times we will have are when we are connecting with other people. That people are generally good, and open, and opening yourself up to them shouldn't be feared.¬†


You learned we don't need to be afraid of new people and experiences. Not every experience will be great, but every great experience starts with a greeting and a smile.¬†


You learned that other people are looking for that connection too, and they are delighted to find it and nurture it. I guarantee everyone at that wedding was just as happy to see you there and get to meet you. They'll be talking about the stranger that ended up at the wedding for years, and it will be a fond memory.¬†


Life is what happens when we deviate from the plan; and it is often so much better, and messier, and more fulfilling than what we THINK we should be doing.¬†


Congratulations on finding yourself. You showed kindness to another, and then you were willing to open yourself up to that connection. In turn, you found yourself surrounded by new friends.¬†

"USEFUL TIPS:

1. Take the commuter train from St. Moritz to Tirano and back. Less expensive than the Bernina, less pushy tourists trying to claw past you for a photo out the window, more stops (what‚Äôs the rush?). Downsides are that it‚Äôs less cozy than First Class Bernina, and the Bernina makes tourist stops at Alp Gr√ºm to let passengers get epic photos from that spot.

2. If you want to take the Bernina, DO NOT get First Class seats! First Class are huge panoramic windows, but they are not openable and throw glare and tint on any photo taken though them. Found this out the hard way, and it was beyond frustrating. Not sure if this post is from Second Class, but the commuter train DEFINITELY has drop windows. We ended up taking the commuter back from Tirano to St. Moritz, and the feeling of the wind in your face and being able to peer out the windows is an unbelievable experience.

"‚Äú...She goes to the window, curious to look out, and her senses
awaken. It was only a moment ago (for sleep knows no time) that the
flat horizon was a loamy gray swell merging into the fog behind the
icy glass. But now rocky, powerful mountains are massing out of the
ground (where have they come from?), a vast, strange, overwhelming
sight. This is her first glimpse of the unimaginable majesty of the
Alps, and she sways with surprise. Just now a first ray of sun through
the pass to the east is shattering into a million reflections on the
ice field covering the highest peak. The white purity of this
unfiltered light is so dazzling and sharp that she has to close her
eyes for a moment, but now she‚Äôs wide awake. One push and the window
bangs down, to bring this marvel closer, and fresh air‚Äîice-cold,
glass-sharp, and with a bracing dash of snow‚Äîstreams through her lips,
parted in astonishment, and into her lungs, the deepest, purest breath
of her life. She spreads her arms to take in this first reckless gulp,
and immediately, her chest expanding, feels a luxurious warmth rise
through her veins‚Äîmarvelous, marvelous. Inflamed with cold, she takes
in the scene to the left and the right; her eyes (thawed out now)
follow each of the granite slopes up to the icy epaulet at the top,
discovering, with growing excitement, new magnificence everywhere‚Äîhere
a white waterfall tumbling headlong into a valley, there neat little
stone houses tucked into crevices like birds' nests, farther off an
eagle circling proudly over the very highest heights, and above it all
a wonderfully pure, sumptuous blue whose lush, exhilarating power she
would never have thought possible. Again and again she returns to
these Alps sprung overnight from her sleep, an incredible sight to
someone leaving her narrow world for the first time. These immense
granite mountains must have been here for thousands of years; they'll
probably still be here millions and millions of years from now, every
one of them immovably where it‚Äôs always been, and if not for the
accident of this journey, she herself would have died, rotted away,
and turned to dust with no inkling of their glory. She‚Äôs been living
as though all this didn‚Äôt exist, never saw it, hardly cared to; like a
fool she dozed off in this tiny little room, hardly longer than her
arm, hardly wide enough for her feet, just a night away, a day away
from this infinitude, these manifold immensities! Indifferent and
without desires before, now she‚Äôs beginning to realize what she‚Äôs been
missing. This contact with the overpowering is her first encounter
with travel‚Äôs disconcerting ability to strip the hard shell of habit
from the heart, leaving only the bare, fertile kernel.‚Äù

"Way back in 2002 before destination weddings were even a thing we chose our wedding date based on a cheap airfare from Florida to Florence and the fact that you were able to legally get married in Italy. \(No stop at the courthouse in the U.S.\)  We were married in the Palazzo Vecchio which is the Medici  Palace in Florence. Sounds fancy right? That is their courthouse and was where all civil ceremonies were performed. It just added another dimension to our travel because we got to see parts of Florence no normal tourist sees like the inside of the U.S. consulate, the Sala Rossa in the the Palazzo Vecchio, and some of the office buildings like the notaries office. The Vice Mayor of Florence performed the ceremony in Italian and an interpreter translated to English. Our wedding certificate which was filed with the U.S. consulate was written all in Italian and we joke that for all we know, we bought a  laundromat since we signed things we weren't able to read ourselves.

Its nice that more people are choosing this type of wedding option.  We chose to elope in the forest of a Canadian gulf island for a number of reasons, it was planned and told family and friends about it in advance.

The ceremony was simple and casual. It was just us and a local celebrant and witness at a private spot by the water. The next day, a photographer friend we knew came over and took some amazing wedding photos in the middle of the forest. 

Its amazing how many couples tell us they wish they could do it / have done it that way, but it‚Äôs not an option for them because there family would not allow it.  

Love seeing people spending their special day doing exactly what THEY want to do. Thanks for sharing!

"Stopped into a pachinko  („Éë„ÉÅ„É≥„Ç≥) parlor in Tokyo.  I had not read about them at all and had no idea what I was doing.  I started playing and my wife and kids were sitting outside.  I was playing and playing and playing... and I kept telling the guy that I was done.  I didn't want to play anymore.  It was raining outside now and my family walked over to a nearby shop.  He just kept telling me ""Very good game"" over and over.  I finally convinced him that I wanted to quit.  He seemed very perturbed.  

He took all the balls you see behind [me](https://i.imgur.com/6wj4blc.jpg) and poured them into a counting machine (there were a lot more when I finally quit).  Then he took me over to a counter and gave me a little goody bag of a little milk drink and granola bar.  Then he slid across a couple brightly colored shiny gold bars in little plastic cases.  He told me to redeem these at a shop around the corner.  By this time it was pissing rain and I gave the goody bag to my kids and told them I would be right back.  I went to the shop an it was a shady little corner with only a window.  Kind of like a bank teller.  I handed him my little gold chips.  Then he ruffled through bills in a machine.  I had won some $250.  

My wife and kids still make fun of me... ""Oh, no, I want to stop winning, hahaha""  I had no idea what I was doing and just wanted to get out of there.

I have a several good ones,  but I think [this one](https://i.imgur.com/ypY0yWR.jpg) is tops for me.  I was walking around in a small village in Myanmar, and this group of monks pulled us into a little 'restaurant', insisting that we drink and smoke with them.

Germany is 100 times worse. We were only passing through and we're there a very short time but still it was the worst part of my trip. All the staff are incredibly rude and intrusive. No hello how are you or good morning. Just very blunt and borderline offensive questions.

"Sucks that it has happened, and I don't have advice on what to do beyond what others have already said.  I did want to point out that this is not limited to the US.

The first half sounds like both times I flew home connecting out of Vancouver.  One time I was questioned about my trip and things having nothing to do with travel; at one point they questioned why I didn't have luggage, I explained I had a carry-on (I one bag) which was gate checked and missed the flight.  They didn't believe me and I had to wait while they called my earlier airlines to confirm this, nearly missing my connection. I was there for over an hour watching other passengers come and go. The second time, I remember being passed to a different higher level person and thinking their questionnaire was asking pretty invasive question, beyond what was allowed.  No idea why this happened either time.

That said,  I did go two years with all but one flight being randomly selected for additional screening (none to/through/from Canada). When I finally demanded an explanation on I was 'randomly' selected on every flight, TSA said it was because I was a white middle-aged male and not a protected class.

If mountains and hiking, I would suggest the north like Valbona valley, and Theth (a bit hard to get to). Maybe even Tomorr national park which is nearby Berat.

And in general, public transportation can still be hard to navigate for most foreigners on their own.

If I work over forty hours this also adds to my holiday.  I usually end up with about forty days a year maybe more.  With this time I use it to travel .

"I started traveling in 2002 or 2003 after high school. And I did work at the mall so I wasn't making a lot of money. The reason I was able to afford to travel back then was because I got free tickets or I only paid on the taxes because my family worked for a major airline company. Once that expired I started paying the full price. I basically was able to travel because I kept my costs low during college (lived at home and went to public uni) and worked. After graduating college,  I basically ended up saying F it  and I went abroad and I lived abroad teaching English for 3 years which was a great way to travel around Asia because there was a lot of disposable income in those jobs. After that I went to grad school. during grad school I ended up doing study abroad  in Europe which was really helpful because that obviously cut down on a lot of travel costs.

"there's a saying to use other people's money to travel, and one of the few but most effective ways to travel is to travel for work by working for another company. There are many companies with specific job roles that is more efficient in sending someone they have trained internally and then send them overseas for a few days to weeks to either provide support or be the spoke person on behalf of the local teams stationed or hired at.

And since you are travelling for business, some companies makes sure they show that their companies are also doing well which is indicating a good reputation, by making sure their employees stay in a good hotel and travel good flights (usually business class but some companies are starting to cut corners (or saving budget as they claimed) and fly them economy class, but hey, at least you can travel).

That way, you do not have to pay bills, but also get paid for your meals.

"Personally, I‚Äôve been traveling pretty extensively since graduating college (including lots of international trips), even through jobs paying the lower end of a typical salary for a college graduate and periods of unemployment. 

I‚Äôve never gotten money from family - I think the major factors that give me the budget to travel are not having a car payment (paid for my car in full) and being a bit more frugal in other areas of my day to day life. I also got a travel credit card right away, put all my expenses on it, pay it off every month, and accumulate points/rewards to put towards flights.

Traveling is cheaper than people think, the key is to try and be flexible with either the dates or the location (ideally both). From there, you have to do a lot of research on the front end to maximize credit card points, hunt for deals, and plan your trip yourself so you‚Äôre not paying extra for tours or day trips you could DIY.",19,2025-04-20T15:20:40,how do people have the means to travel regularly,travel,personally ave travel pretty extensively graduate college include lot international trip job pay low end typical salary college graduate period unemployment ave get money family think major factor budget travel have car payment pay car bit frugal area day day life get travel credit card right away expense pay month accumulate point reward flight travel cheap people think key try flexible date location ideally lot research end maximize credit card point hunt deal plan trip pay extra tour day trip day,"personally travel pretty extensively graduate college include lot international trip job pay low end typical salary college graduate period unemployment

"You can travel for a lot cheaper if you are willing to sacrifice comfort. Where you draw the line is really up to you. 

For flights: get a good miles reward card and/or learn how to search the internet for cheap flights. Unless you have specific destinations that you HAVE to go to, plan your destinations around where flights are cheapest. 

For lodging: stay in hostels or camp instead of getting a hotel room. Especially in Europe, there are a lot of great hostels and most have shared kitchens (so you can cook too and further save money). 

For food: try to minimize the amount of restaurants  you go to (unless that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre into and you can pay for it). Get a little backpacking stove, find a hostel with a kitchen, or (if driving) carry a hot plate and/or crockpot in your car for hotel meals. But groceries instead of going to restaurants for every meals. No-cook-no-refrigerator meals like bagels w/ peanut butter can take you a long way too. 

For excursions: plan your trip in advance and try to choose cheap activities. Hiking and museums for example are usually pretty cheap or free.

"The American hustle & impress culture ruins the means to travel a lot imo.

You don‚Äôt need a large house to be happy, a big ass Ford F150 raptor and a Rolex around your wrist.

As a non-American it‚Äôs really, *really* jarring to be asked non-stop ‚Äúwhat kind of work do you do?‚Äù So people can scale you, so they can define your status. It‚Äôs really shallow.

Live smaller, drive a smaller more economical car and fuck that 12+ hour workday, 6 days a week to pay for shit you don‚Äôt need because you‚Äôre in an imaginary dick measuring contest with friends, neighbours and colleagues.

Check flight.google.com and set alerts for flight ticket prices you feel comfortable with, travel outside the busy season. Visit countries that aren‚Äôt hyped up constantly, look for cheap places to stay and just explore a place. None of that ‚Äútop 20 things you need to see in X!‚Äù

Just wake up, get a coffee somewhere, unwind, slow your pace, ask locals about their favourite places to eat or hang out and walk wherever you want to go. 

Most people are in competition with influencers who don‚Äôt give a shit where they are. They are paid to be there, to lure more tourists to make a quick buck. Fuck all that noice.

Go to a country you barely know anything about (Georgia, Montenegro, Madeira, Surinam etc) and just enjoy that feel of exploring shit on your own pace.

I‚Äôd rather go to a country for 5 days and just wander around instead of speedrunning 6 cities in 5 days and return home exhausted. It also saves a ton of money.

"If you can be patient and have flexible dates you can find deals. I use Google Flights and for destination use ""Europe"" or ""Latin America"". If you have flexible dates then you can search for 2 weeks in April or 1 week in September kind of thing. Flying from Denver I've had $425 airfare to Costa Rica, Columbia and Peru using that strategy. Find a cheap room someone is renting out in their house on Airbnb, eat with the locals and you have a week long vacation for well under $1,000.

One challenge you'll have is that you'll need to drive to a major airport which might be a few hours because I doubt you'll find those deals from Omaha. Look at the off times when everyone else is working. The time between Thanksgiving and Christmas is nice. Late January is another good time. If you want warmer weather in Europe April and September are shoulder seasons and offer cheaper prices than summer or spring break. 

As others have noted, reward credit cards are awesome. They're only great if you pay them off every month, otherwise you're earning 2% cash back but paying 17% interest and that math doesn't math. Wells Fargo and Citi both offer a 2% cash back card with no annual fee. It might take a few years but save up $1,000 worth and free trip. 

I'm not anywhere close to rich and I live a very frugal life. I don't eat out very often and I rarely will drink when I'm out because it ends up being $10 after tax and tip for a beer I can buy for $2 at the store. All those dollars add up and I can take vacation and get experiences instead.

"I have a few strategies.  First of all I worked overseas for years, so I was already ""there"".  Now I am retired, so I make it a priority.  I keep a travel slush fund and belong to a travel deal site, and can go anytime I can snag cheap deals. (I use Going--formerly Scott's Cheap Flights--and one ""deal"" more than pays for the yearly subscription.  (I think $45).  I'm going to the UK in a couple of weeks for $400 that I found on there. (also helps to live near a travel hub) I stay with a friend while there so it will be a cheap trip.  I live very, very frugally.  I don't have a fancy wardrobe and rarely buy new clothes.  I've never owned designer stuff (apart from a pair of Calvins in the 80s ha).  My house is a modest 70's house that's paid for. I rarely ever eat out or buy expensive coffee drinks.  When I travel, I stay in a place with free breakfast and then eat again around 4 or 5:00 so I only buy one meal a day. In really expensive places I get an Airbnb with a kitchen and cook my own meals.  I time excursions to catch off-peak prices or free days, etc. Oh, and the #1 money saver?  I never had kids.  I always wanted two, so I figure there's $500,000 to put towards travel. lol But as we know here in the US, we are all just one medical emergency away from the poor house so I work out several times a week and walk every day to try to stay healthy and in shape to be able to hike, climb, get to what I want to see. I also have combined medical care with travel to save money--dentists in Buenos Aires and Istanbul!   Bottom line: prioritize.  ps--I also side hustle pet watching on Rover.

"What frequency do you consider ‚Äútraveling regularly‚Äù?

Wife and I had no kids. I went to college and got a mechanical engineering degree. We didn‚Äôt go on any trips except for maybe 1 every 2 years. She went to college and got a nursing degree. Now we go on 1 or 2 big trips a year, mostly limited by my works vacation time. 

I have had some years where I really try to take the most advantage of my time off. If there‚Äôs a 3 day weekend then that‚Äôs an opportunity to drive/fly somewhere Saturday, explore it Sunday, drive/fly back Monday. 

Mostly though when it seems like someone travels somewhere all the time, and it seems like ‚Äúthey‚Äôve been there‚Äù when someone else is talking about a place, it‚Äôs just from consistent travel over time. 

My wife started working in 2018ish so we started really traveling then.  That was 7 years ago, we didn‚Äôt go anywhere in 2020 or 2021, but she did do some travel nursing in Wisconsin so we ended up doing a drive across that state in the winter to go to Green Bay and Madison.  Not as ‚Äúexotic‚Äù as a trip to Portugal or Korea or wherever, but still enjoyed it just as much. 

Cost wise‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not really much more expensive to go to Europe or Asia as it is compared to the US.  In the US you‚Äôre spending $200+ per night for a safe, clean, bug free hotel. Meals are $20 per person with the tip. 

Going to Europe you‚Äôll spend less per night on the hotel and less per meal, more like $12 per meal since there‚Äôs no tip requirement.  Asia is even better, Korea you can get a good enough hotel for less than $150 per night, meals are about $10 per person cause of the exchange rate. In Europe and Asia, subway and bus systems will take you wherever you want to go for pennies, so no need to take expensive Ubers everywhere.

"Simple. For most people (that aren‚Äôt wealthy and/or retired), it‚Äôs just about priorities. So for example, someone may like having their nails done and a nice car, while another person keeps their bills and spending to a minimum so they can afford travel. There is also super affordable ways to travel if you are eager enough and willing to (or even enjoy) the discomfort. Hostels, couch surfing, hitch hiking, volunteering for a free place to stay and even food some times. I have traveled the world with very little money when I was younger. Now that I‚Äôm older, I actually enjoy a little more comfort at home and when I travel. Nothing super fancy, but I also am more financially stable as well.

"**Money Out** \- I don't drink much (maybe one drink every two weeks) and I don't smoke or use any drugs.  My car is from 2009 and I have no accidents on my record so my insurance payments are low.  I cook my meals at home and only go to restaurants for special events with friends or family. Literally, I've used Uber Eats *once* in my entire life, and it was at midnight in South Africa because I didn't feel safe walking alone to get food. My most common activities are going for walks, reading books from the library and volunteering - none of that costs money.  I buy my clothes on sale and wear them until they don't fit or are falling apart.  

**Money In** \- I have never not worked. I started working in high school and I worked throughout university.  During summer breaks I worked 12+ hours a day, often between two or three jobs. When I started my ""career"" I picked up part-time shifts whenever the office was closed.  Now I still pick up freelancing jobs on top of my day job.  

It's not so much about travel as it is about deciding what to prioritize in your finances. I prioritize making money and spending it on travel. Other people might prioritize having more free time and spending their money on cigarettes or a pick-up truck.",8,2025-04-20T15:19:27,how do people have the means to travel regularly,travel,"money drink maybe drink week smoke use drug car accident record insurance payment low cook meal home restaurant special event friend family literally ave user eat entire life midnight south africa feel safe walk food common activity go walk read book library volunteering cost money buy clothe sale wear fit fall apart

"Premium air travel is all **relative** comfort, not absolute luxury. Business class flights are nice in relation to economy flights, but no one who thinks about it for a minute would believe that being able to lay flat on narrow bed, watch TV and be fed from a tray is especially luxurious compared to what you can do at home. It's just that business class is much better when compared to the often-hellishness of flying in the back of the plane.

Airport lounges are the same. They are relatively nice compared to the melee of an airport terminal, but they are not especially nice compared to being at home or in a proper restaurant or bar. How could they be? Eating and drinking self-serve in a quiet space is not particularly luxurious or special for most travellers.

(There are a tiny number of exceptions - e.g. LH has a whole separate terminal building in FRA for F-class passengers that is actually luxurious - but as a general rule it stands.)",14,2025-04-23T17:50:46,Unpopular Opinion: I'd rather sit at home than an airport lounge,travel,premium air travel relative comfort absolute luxury business class flight nice relation economy flight think minute believe able lie flat narrow bed watch fed tray especially luxurious compare home business class well compare selfishness fly plane airport lounge relatively nice compare melee airport terminal especially nice compare home proper restaurant bar eat drink self serve quiet space particularly luxurious special traveller tiny number exception edge la separate terminal building fra class passenger actually luxurious general rule stand,"premium air travel relative comfort absolute luxury business class flight nice relation economy flight think minute believe able lie flat narrow bed watch tv fed tray especially luxurious compare home business class well compare hellishness fly plane

"My use of the lounge has nothing to do with ""guzzling as much free wine as they can.""

Personally, I do not like being rushed at the airport. Being able to take my time, knowing that I have plenty of time to get where I need to be without having to worry about long check in or security lines, weirdness at screening points or any of the the thousand things that can slow you down at the airport is key to keeping my stress level down when I travel.  So I personally tend to arrive at the airport 60 or more minutes prior to departure, with the exact time depending on where and when I'm traveling.

The vast majority of the time, I make it airside and have plenty of time to get to my gate.  And that's why I like having lounge access, because it's more comfortable than sitting at the gate.  The WiFi's better. If something happens with my flight I've got easy and convenient access to an airline agent (because I'm in an airline lounge and not the Priority Pass Lounge) to help me sort things out. The restrooms are cleaner and usually less crowded. And yes, I can grab a snack or more importantly for those early morning flights a decent cup of coffee - for free. At most (but definitely not all) airport lounges it's also calmer and quieter than sitting at the gate. 

Oh, and as an added bonus - when I fly Delta from ORD there's a possibility that I can board the flight DIRECTLY FROM THE LOUNGE! I admit, there's not too many places where that's a perk of lounge access, but when you can take advantage of it it's pretty awesome.

Now that's if you're in the US where gate areas tend to have quite a bit of seating - things are very different at European airports where they don't really encourage passengers to arrive at their gates early.  Again, a lounge is a nice alternative to walking laps through duty free or trying to find a clean table or place to sit in a food court and central waiting area while you wait for the notification that it's time to head to the gate area for boarding.

"Yeah. Theoretically they do this to discourage ""hidden city ticketing"" where you just bail on the flight halfway through. For instance, I flew from Las Vegas to Amsterdam last week, and the flight was ‚Ç¨1200 if I booked KLM Las Vegas -> Amsterdam, but the same exact flight was ‚Ç¨560 if I booked KLM Las Vas -> Amsterdam -> Luxembourg. So adding an additional flight leg saved ‚Ç¨640. Why airlines do this, no idea, but if you are flying into a large hub airport as your final target destination (Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Salt Lake City, whatever), it is quite frequently cheaper to buy two one-way tickets with hidden city ticketing and just bail on the second leg of the flight. It's a mystery to me too.

  
You can check this right now for fun. Look on Google Flights, look for one-way tickets from Las Vegas to Amsterdam, and look for KLM. The direct flight LAS->AMS next Monday (28th) is ‚Ç¨1526, but the direct flight LAS->AMS->LUX on the same day, the exact same first flight, is ‚Ç¨1230.

1. on the way there, they delayed our flight from Toronto to Tokyo because in flight entertainment didn't work. let us know after we were boarded, so we had to upload our luggage, wait 3 hours and reload with many people missing connections in Tokyo. No reimbursement given. 

2. on the way back, they rebooked us without our permission because the first flight had the potential to be delayed by weather and we may miss our second flight. the first flight was never actually delayed, we would have made it, but they gave our seats away, so we couldn't request them back

3. on the way back they thought they rebooked us on a direct flight but it was actually 3 separate flights with 45 mins to 60 mins in between each connection,  including a time where we would have to clear immigration/security again. I don't think we would have made it.

4. then, the first of the 3 flights was delayed 60 mins  so it would have been impossible to make the remaining flights and we would have been stranded across the country. 

5. we were telling the air canada people at the booth all this and they told us we would have to pay to rebook the flights. then we argued and they told us we would have to call the airline center. then, they closed the booth and all left for the day while we were calling the air canada hotline

Like if you bought Las Vegas -> Amsterdam -> Luxembourg ; return Amsterdam -> Las Vegas, but if you did not board the Amsterdam -> Luxembourg flight, then YES they will always 100% of the time cancel your Amsterdam -> Las Vegas return ticket. If you bought a single ticket with 8 different flight legs, as soon as you miss a single flight leg, they cancel all remaining flight legs. So in this case if you wanted a cheaper ticket you'd have to buy two one-way tickets: Las Vegas -> AMS -> LUX (get off in AMS), and then a separate one-way ticket AMS -> Las Vegas.

Similarly, if you see that Lux -> AMS -> Las Vegas is ‚Ç¨500 cheaper than AMS -> Las Vegas, you can't just board the plane in Amsterdam; if you missed the Lux -> AMS flight, then your ticket is cancelled.

What they will not do is flag you as a bad bad person, and then on a future ticket, purchased some day in the future, will they cancel your ticket because once upon a time in the past you ""abused"" hidden-city ticketing.",1,2025-04-24T16:48:33,My parents missed (no showed) a connecting flight.

"I love India but it definitely is another world and can be intimidating.  As a Nordic looking white lady traveling alone, I received some long stares.  I cannot tell you how many people roped me into their family photos for some unknown reason.    I found India loud, colorful, crowded, rich, poor, frenetic and peaceful.  It is the sort of place that requires total immersion.  Anything less will not yield a love match.  I would caution against planning a hermetically sealed trip that focuses on western hotels, private tours, etc.  You will miss the best of India if you take that route.  I was extremely fortunate to arrange a couple of meetings with Indians before I left home.  One happened by chance through LinkedIn.  I answered a question to which an Indian man responded.  He ended up introducing me to several folks in Mumbai who became my local friends.  All of them were excited to share aspects of the culture with me.  Rashi took me shopping and threw a party for me.  Ronan took me for a food tour of Bandra that culminated in dinner at a Parsi restaurant.  Mohit took me shopping and on to a pre-wedding celebration held on a rooftop surrounded by swaying palms.  When I contracted pneumonia and developed a pneumothorax, Mohit took me to his doctor and came to see me everyday while I was in the hospital.  He is still a dear friend.  Sumit made sure I made it safely to the airport in my weakened state.  I met a group of women through a shared love of fiber arts.  Three of them took me shopping and showered me with small gifts over an afternoon of knitting together.  Another knitter asked me to come to her home for dinner, later revising the invitation to include having me as a house guest and showing me things I would never have seen about her region had I been the typical tourist.  The human connections I was blessed to make with Indians and the things they were generous enough to share with me were hands down the best parts of my trip.    Some not great things happened as well.  I expect that with any long trip but they were far and away eclipsed by the wonderful experiences I had seeing not only the typical sites, but the things Indians were proud to show me.    If you are open to it, you will find magic, beauty and grace in India.

"I‚Äôd like to add a perspective on why the staring exists.¬†

1. Even amongst/within Indian people, some people will often stare out of curiosity if they see something different. The ‚Äúit‚Äôs rude to stare‚Äù etiquette somehow wasn‚Äôt ingrained into the psyche of people so when they see something that is unexpected, as opposed to a quick glance they will just stare.¬†

2. Combined with #1 above, most small town Indians have rarely seen or interacted with someone ‚Äúnon Indian‚Äù or of a different skin color than theirs. ¬†So their curiosity is at 100% (who is this person, what are they doing here, do they speak like me, wow their hair is different etc etc).

Of course unfortunately there is a #3 for women travelers which is that there are certainly some shitty men out there who are thinking bad thoughts BUT I would say by and large in most cases it is curiosity rather than bad intentions¬†",10,2025-04-05T03:13:22,First and Maybe Last Visit to India?,travel,"cd like add perspective staring exist ¬†

Most foreigners have India in their bucket list purely because of Taj Mahal ,so they visit TM, Agra, most of old Delhi ,Jaipur and decide to dislike the country.
