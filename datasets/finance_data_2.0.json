Duh, how do you think we all got so rich?\n\n[As of 2012](https://ballotpedia.org/Net_worth_of_United_States_Senators_and_Representatives) (latest data available, we should really force another review somehow):\n\n* US Congress average worth: $7,888,502 \n* US Senate average worth: $14,013,596  \n\n* US Senate Democrats average: $13,566,333 \n* US Senate Republicans average: $6,956,438\n\n[US Senate salary](https://www.senate.gov/senators/SenateSalariesSince1789.htm) (not average, set across the board): $174,000.\n\nAverage of $8M - $14M on a salary of $174k.\n\nI know software engineers at Google who have been pulling in more salary and more stock options, for 10 years, who aren’t even close to those numbers.  The only ones that are, made significant returns in the stock market.\n\n1. Public service positions should not be seen as a way to get rich, nor used that way.\n2. Term limits.  Preferably tied to a few factors independent of office - say, 10-12 years so they can serve under both parties Presidents, but also some metrics for doing their job well and restrictions on time / money spent campaigning for re-election vs working.\n3. While I’m smoking this crack pipe and dreaming of things they’ll never pass into law anytime soon, let’s also throw in some restrictions on age.  If you get elected at 55 after retiring from work, good for you.  Serving till 67 or so is fine.  If you got elected at 25 and have stayed in office for 50+ years by running unopposed, gerrymandering, consolidating power, etc, no.  If you’re older than literally half or more of the average nursing home residents, it’s time to step down (looking at you, 85+ year old representatives and senators).  We could tie this one to “no older than the country’s median life expectancy plus X standard deviations” or “median life expectancy - 10%” or something.  Incentivize them to make improvements for all in order to stay in office longer.\n\nNow, that’s not to say I don’t appreciate the job they do.  I’m not trying to undersell the complexities of law or difficulty in hashing things out with eternal compromises.  Pay our representatives fairly and competitively, perhaps based on a % or multiplier of the median cost of living in their state.  After all we also don’t want to underpay to the point where *nobody* wants the job.  But we need some serious changes to the government money tap.",

This means they send your trade to a market maker to fulfill.  They do this because they make money off of order flow.\n\nWho do the orders go through?  Two Sigma, Citadel, and Virtu, amongst others.\n\nThose market makers decide what order flow they will accept.  They can tell any \"Broker\" (which is what Robin Hood is) that they will not accept any type of order they choose.  Thats not technically manipulation.\n\nIf you have a seat on the NYSE or you are a market maker, you can still buy or sell GME whenever you want.\n\nComplain all youd like, this is 100% legal, and Ive been telling people how dangerous this is for days and everyone downvotes me to the grave.\n\nI think its fucked and shady 100%.  I want to stick it to the man.  But you need to know how to play the game to win it, and too many of you are inexperienced traders to play it right.\n\nIf you all wanted to start a WSB market maker with a seat on the NYSE you could pay the roughly $100,000 to get the seat and pay the respective compliance costs, then build the trading platform to do it.  Its actually not even that hard to do.\n\nEdit:  I 100% think this behavior is immoral and shitty, I am just trying to help people understand what is going on.  Fuck these guys.\n\nEdit 2:  Turns out they couldnt send orders through the intermediaries bc they were requiring excess capital to continue transacting.  Robin hood drew all their credit lines down and lacked the liquidity to pony up dough to the intermediaries to transact.  Sounds like Robin Hood isnt well funded enough and Citadel et all knew they could cut them off by forcing them to add excess capital.",

Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**\n\n\nWe the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.\n\n\n**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**\n\n\n*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*\n\n\n**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**\n\n\n*Question 41\nQ: What about short positions?\nA: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.*\n\n\n**Contact the SEC and let them know retail investors demand increased transparency (https://www.sec.gov/contact-information/sec-directory)**",

And former President Donald Trump recently called for a similar state-owned investment fund to finance “great national endeavors” during a campaign stop at the Economic Club of New York.\n\nThat’s not a sovereign wealth fund. A sovereign wealth fund is where a state sells nationally owned commodities (typically oil) and invests the profits in stocks, bonds, etc. then pays out profits to the country’s citizens as shareholders. Norway, the UAE, Alaska, etc. fit into this model. \n\nWhat Trump and Biden are proposing is just a roundabout way of selling more Treasury bonds (increasing the national debt) and distributing funds to key swing state voters. It’s no different from issuing more Treasury bonds except there’s less bipartisan oversight.\n\n> It is unclear how an American fund would be funded or how it would operate. \n\nNo kidding.",

Pretty soon it will all be going to the government and citizens won't get anything (it's voted on every year). Liberals think the answer is to tax oil companies more, but oil companies are leaving the state because it's cost prohibitive and doesn't economically make sense to continue investing in Alaska. It worked great until liberals started getting overly greedy, now it's going to 💩. I'd say it's a perfect example of UBI though, works for a while until the weath creators are taxed out of the economy and all the money goes away with them.",

While the funds do come from excess taxes on oil and gas revenues on state land a couple of caveats here. \n\nThe dividend comes from the investment fund the taxes are deposited in. The fund has been, in the opinion of many residents, criminally mismanaged. Between the mismanagement and the state’s current fiscal crisis, the dividend is at real risk of being ending in our lifetimes. One of the largest mistakes with the fund was allowing the state legislature to have some control over it.\n\nEdit: the other issue is that the fund is from tax revenue of resource extraction on state lands. The vast majority of new leases and exploration are happening on federal lands. So new forms of revenue are beginning to stagnate.",

It's almost entirely an organization to keep Russia in check, and more countries will be far more interested in joining and/or supporting after this naked aggression.\n\nWhat do you think them having a decentralized currency would do? They would be able to trade with each other and that's it. That loses value quickly when you can't export anything or import raw materials. It's not like the rest of the world wouldn't know what currency they were using. Or they could bet everything on an unstable, volatile crypto route, which can simply be denied in most markets, and could easily result in far more rapid declines in their buying power.\n\nRussia's allegiance has always been to Russia and only Russia.\n\nShould they leave the world economy they will end up in a similar destitute state as North Korea.

It is a vertical integration for the bank--Capital One.\n\nVisa, MC and AMEX needs a more integrated competitor and consumers, especially small businesses  will benefit. Processing fees are out of hand--there needs to be more competition in the processing business. A deeper pocket with a lot of cards--Capital One--can propel Discover into a LOT more processing business.\n\nWarren is just mouthing off. Cardholders have plenty of choices and this merger will not significantly change that. It is the people that take the cards for payment that need to see more competition and making Discover stronger will help bring pressure on processing fee.",

          "text": "These kinds of timelines are based not our economy’s *potential* performance but on the history of its actual performance so far. The projection only works if trends continue as they have.\n\nThis track record is something we will need to reevaluate in light of a transformative new development just over the horizon: the invention and implementation of a Universal Income (UBI).\n\nMost people talking about UBI see it as a welfare policy—or a safety net for workers displaced by robots in the future. These framings cause us to miss something far more important: the radical economic and environmental implications of labor-free spending money.\n\nUBI enables a startling new perspective on the cause of our current environmental crisis: not excessive consumption but unnecessary employment. Without realizing it, we have been overworking ourselves and damaging our environment as a byproduct.\n\nIn our monetary system, the relationship between money and work makes our economy wasteful by design. In order to allow people to consume, we first have to come up with some sort of job in order to get them paid.\n\nThe problem with tying income to wages like this is that wages only get paid out to those who work. That means we have to make everybody work to get people on incomes—totally apart from the question of whether or not the economy actually needs all that work.\n\nIn other words, standard macroeconomic practices today is to maximize employment. Maximizing employment may maximize the distribution of wages; but deliver incomes in that way is the opposite of the ideal outcome so far as the environment is concerned.\n\nIf we’re creating jobs as an excuse to distribute money, that means we’re not creating jobs only when production requires them. And all these extra jobs use up scarce resources from the environment. They create waste byproducts, too, like greenhouse gasses.\n\nThe economy in theory could have a much smaller environmental footprint if we simply let people consume through a UBI, allowed employment to reduce, and discovered just how *small* our economy could get while still producing the maximum possible goods and services for people.\n\nIn an economy with $0 UBI and “maximum employment” policy instead, we can’t help but waste resources on superfluous work—even while some or many people stay needlessly poor. We live in one big resource-wasting machine that’s driven not greed or malice but by ignorance: our failure to institute a simple, efficient mechanism for enabling consumption.\n\nWhen consumption is only allowed through *work* (resource-use) we have to use up way more resources than we need to sustain any given level of output. And it’s the use of resources—not the consumption of final goods—where waste products, pollution and greenhouse gasses are actually generated.\n\nClimate change isn’t necessarily an inevitable result of markets or profits; it has resulted from our *version* of a market economy, an economy where consumption is only allowed through work; this creates a perverse incentive across all of society to create useless work as an excuse to consume. The environment gets chewed up in the process.\n\nPeople who attribute environmental damage to rampant consumerism are missing the fundamental distinction between resource-use and production itself. Efficiency developments in theory should allow all of us to make more and consume more despite using fewer resources and being employed less often.\n\nOur economy is the definition of inefficient. It’s designed to maximize “employment opportunities” rather than to maximize consumer outcomes. A well-intentioned but short-sighted commitment to employment itself is causing us to waste resources, hobble production, and bloat our industries’ collective environmental footprint.\n\nIt’s only *after* we implement a UBI and see how high it can go—and how far employment could fall—that we can discover just how clean our economy could really be. Climate change activists, business leaders and economists are all talking past each other on this issue; and the blind spot is UBI.\n\nA simple, reliable source of consumer income that doesn’t depend on jobs being created is a crucial part of the monetary system. It’s how we receive economic benefit without wasting work.\n\nThe lack of this mechanism from our macroeconomic policy toolkit is very likely causing far more waste today than we realize.",

I'm not just making shit up here, there are literally THOUSANDS of studies backing this up.  \n  \nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-power-of-prime/200912/popular-culture-we-are-what-we-consume  \n  \nYou need to get yourself past \"knee jerk\" and realize that a lot of what you spew is provably wrong, literally just in 3 minutes using an internet search. We in fact ARE replacing a deeper expression of our collective experiences with things like \"the biggest loser\" and \"the hangover\" and it's evident in many ways.  \n  \nI also think you fundamentally misunderstood \"the problem\" with the \"moral panic\" movements you're trying to tie me to with your knee jerking. They weren't wrong about influence, they were simply wrong about what they were trying to preserve. Those moral panics were trying to preserve cultures of hatred, exclusion, and control, and were mad that \"pop\" or \"rock\" or whatever at the time was making people's minds more open and tolerant, things antithetical to \"the way things were\". That is not what is happening today, today we're seeing a cheapening of ideas into sound bites, nobody is quoting Sartre or Voltaire or Alan Watts any more, they are quoting \"Mean Girls\" and nobody is really looking critically at what our society is becoming, they're coping with the bullshit idea that Hollywood implanted- The good guys always win.",

And originally was at the church because they were the only ones who could read, and then it was  the nobles and then it was the government who was controlled and shaped by the former nobles who are now aristocrats, then became the gentleman who were owners of industry and it's been them ever since and they've dictated everything through government.

Without being a forensic accountant, I’m not sure what is happening, but if it’s legit, it could be a write down on book value of fixed assets once they marked to market. I’ll take a closer look when I’m home. The Wharton professor has a good take as well. I didn’t see an income statement charge for write downs though so my initial hypothesis may not be correct. But will chomp on this when I’m home.\n\nEdit: looks like it’s in the supplemental section of cash flows where they acquired $1.4billion in fixed assets that did not have a cash effect (maybe paid it on credit or with a revolver / ABL for the time being)",

Built many a fixed asset reconciliation and management system to support.\n\nThe only thing that pops to mind is they might have recognized capitalization of a series of assets still with accrued liability (AP) in earlier reporting quarters and YE24, the series of AP in question was paid. $1.4B is a HUGE variance though. [Effectively, they purchased 1.4B of assets on credit and didn’t pay their bill.] This does happen, but is weird because a company this big would have a strong purchasing procedure that would use POs for these asset purchases. The POs are legally binding and most vendors wouldn’t let large purchases go unpaid because they have their own cash issues to deal with. Even without a PO a reputable vendor would cover their ass with enforceable agreements. This is all null if there are some weird payment terms that are favorable to Tesla (could happen for the prestige of working with such a company - I’ve seen it with S&P500 companies that shaft their vendors). Either way, I would investigate the court system in Texas and California for any legal grievances filed in the last 9 months against Tesla.\n\nThe Wharton Professor’s point written about possibly capitalizing expenses that shouldn’t be: that’s possible in this scenario, but $1.4B is a huge amount of purchasing activity that would normally not be bought with a PO. This kind of stuff would be slamming Tesla’s credit report in DnB showing they are a shit payer and alerting vendors and large clients that they have an internal issue, regardless of how much cash they claim to have.",

This supply function is nominally accomplished by international trade, with the country holding reserve currency status being required to run an inevitable trade deficit.",

And it was an adjustment from mostly isolationist to globalist in less than a decade.\n\nWhen the negotiations between Russia, England and the US came at the end of that war, the world was carved up and that meant the wealth belonging to the victorious also.  We had to have gotten a lion’s share of the spoils.\n\nThis edge was gained by the US and it led to the basis forming for the global financial dominance that was yet to come.\n\nAfter the german rocket scientist hunt was concluded, many, many, many GI vets came home to obtain tens of thousands of advanced degrees in the sciences, law and finance, spurring the growth and establishment the intellectual capital pool and of dollar dominance that lasted an amazing long time and isn’t over quite yet.\n\nThere simply isn’t enough riches elsewhere to really displace the greenback.\n\nBRIC languishes, China at number two is hiding how badly they’re really economically doing.  I don’t know wtf the current administration is doing to the economy with all this shifting positions to keep the opposition on its back footing constantly.\n\nBut the bottom line is nobody has more wealth and more expertise and that’s going to do pretty well for some time to come.  \n\nThat’s my theory.

The reason is the *kind* of crude we've been pumping isn't heavy enough to make things like Diesel and Jet Fuel. Pumping \\*more\\* doesn't help much because it's still the wrong kind of crude.\n* Rare earths - While the US does have the deposits the problem is refining.  Refining rare earths creates tons (literally) of toxic and radioactive waste.  Where is that supposed to go? Keep in mind that we've never been able to open Yucca Mountain despite decades of studies.\n* Generic drugs and Pharmaceuticals active ingredients - At present nearly 100% of our generics come from India, and nearly all the precursors or active ingredients needed make drugs comes from China. The US does have FDA approved facilities for making drugs but nearly all of them make super high margin, on patent drugs.  On the active ingredient side, i.e., chemical manufacturing do we have an appetite for all the toxic waste \\*that\\* generates?\n\nIn all three cases because there are no domestic sources or substitutes with a weakened dollar you're looking at just increased costs overall.

The thing about a trade war is that the other side can retaliate, and then so can we, and then so can they, etc. Also that in many cases tariffs cause unanticipated consequences long after implemented. \n\nLike the China tariffs during Trump 1.0 - washers went up due to parts coming from China, but then dryers went up with no parts from China as they're sold together and companies saw an opportunity. They've never come back down and that price raise happened over years. Source: https://www.aeaweb.org/research/washing-machines-2018-tariffs-effect\n\nUltimately those tariffs cost US consumers far more than it would have cost just to create the jobs gained directly.\n\nTariffs and especially trade wars like the one we're in now are like that, they sound great to populists but it's very rare that they result in anything other than 2 losers, at least at a national level.\n\nThis was all learned decades, even a century ago, over and over again; which is why everyone informed on the matter is flabbergasted at this approach. There's all downside, little to no upside, regardless of what the admin's goals are. For lack of a better description, it's dumb to the nth degree.",

The sheer volume of Russian oligarchs who happen to have an address at trump towers by 94 makes it self evident that they were all looking for a place to launder the money they smuggled out of the USSR.  They stole from the people in the USSR so systematically that making the cash look convincingly legitimate literally became the physical burden of perestroika. \n\nA moscow street thug wears a track suit. \n\nWhen he rebrands himself as an oligarch he wears Armani until everyone at the country club makes fun of him for being too basic. \n\nBeing an ultra rich predator is an….evolutionary process.\n\nBut your con clock never stops ticking. \n\nCommunism was an inherently flawed system simply because in the absence of self regulation of greed, it systematically facilitated a class of those without the ability to empathize to rule over the 97%  of people who would split their last meal with you because their soul  intrinsically understands what it feels like to be hungry and would wish that on no one. And it locked them all together behind an iron curtain. \n\nOver enough  generations greed, unchecked, becomes the dominant evolutionary trait or behavior and kindness and empathy is effectively bred out. \n\nAbout 1.2% of adult men and 0.3% to 0.7% of adult women are considered to have clinically significant levels of psychopathic traits. Those numbers rise exponentially in prison where 15% to 25% of inmates show these characteristics.  But that number is revelatory when you sort by zip code and regardless of any race, religion or cultural constraints. Psychopathy is an equal opportunity predator.  It relies on sowing division in its prey. This was the entire purpose of the KGB. \n\nhttps://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/23/washington-dc-the-psychopath-capital-of-america-218892/\n\nWhen a psychopathic human trafficking Russian oligarch, a greedy media mogul, a narcissistic technocrat and a soulless mercenary all share urinals at their Sun Valley Allen&Co retreat, their Aspen art society and Monaco yacht club, they become the cancer that can be traced simply by changing the search parameters to sort by location and net worth instead of nationality, race, religion or political party. (You can even use the ADS-B data from their private jets as a cross check) \n\nCancer doesn’t care what cells it corrupts.
